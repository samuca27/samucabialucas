O WordPress 6.0 é um exemplo do compromisso da comunidade em enfrentar esses desafios difíceis juntos.

Explore mais maneiras de otimizar seu processo de criação de conteúdo, incluindo:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Selecione o texto em vários blocos e edite tudo de uma vez.</li><li>Digite abre colchetes duas vezes <code>[[</code> para acessar rapidamente o menu de links.</li><li>Mantenha os estilos existentes ao transformar alguns blocos de um tipo para outro, de um bloco de parágrafo para um bloco de código, por exemplo.</li><li>Crie botões personalizados e quaisquer novos botões que você criar manterão as personalizações de estilo automaticamente.</li><li>Torne as nuvens de tags e os ícones sociais ainda mais atraentes com configurações e controles atualizados e um novo estilo de contorno para a nuvem de tags.</li></ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://br.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/about-60-style-switching.gif\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"602\" height=\"452\" src=\"https://br.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/about-60-style-switching.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2501\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Troca de estilo</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Os temas de bloco agora incluem a opção de conter múltiplas variações de estilo. Isso expande ainda mais o novo sistema de estilos e permite que atalhos mudem a aparência do seu site, tudo dentro de um único tema. Você pode alterar tanto as configurações disponíveis, como o peso da fonte e as opções de estilo, como a paleta de cores padrão.

A visualização de lista pode ser aberta e fechada facilmente. Ela vem recolhida por padrão e se expande automaticamente para a seleção atual sempre que você seleciona um bloco.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://br.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/image-5.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\" src=\"https://br.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/image-5-1024x769.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2505\" srcset=\"https://br.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/image-5-1024x769.png 1024w, https://br.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/image-5-300x225.png 300w, https://br.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/image-5-768x577.png 768w, https://br.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/image-5-440x330.png 440w, https://br.wordpress.org/files/2022/05/image-5.png 1204w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Controles de bloqueio de bloco</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Agora você pode bloquear seus blocos. Escolha desativar a opção de mover um bloco, remover um bloco ou ambos. Isso simplifica a entrega do projeto, permitindo que seus clientes liberem sua criatividade sem se preocupar em quebrar acidentalmente o site no processo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Melhorias de acessibilidade da versão WordPress 6.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Acessibilidade é parte integrante da missão do WordPress de promover uma comunidade inclusiva e apoiar usuários de todos os tipos em todo o mundo.

Edite ao seu gosto.<br><strong>Reter estilos</strong>: Mantenha seus estilos personalizados no lugar, seja transformando entre blocos ou criando novos botões.<br><strong>Mais padrões em mais lugares</strong>: o Quick Inserter apresenta padrões que podem funcionar bem para a condição em que você está, criando padrões relevantes para partes de modelo e páginas em que você está trabalhando.<br><strong>Melhorias na visualização de lista</strong>: Novos atalhos de teclado (shift + clique) permitem selecionar vários blocos para modificar em massa (reposicionar, excluir, etc.), ver seu conteúdo rapidamente com uma visualização recolhida por padrão e muito mais.<br><strong>Ferramentas de design refinadas</strong>: Explore um novo painel de cores, opções de transparência, mais variações de blocos de grupo para criar novas opções de layout (pilha, linha), a capacidade de definir sua imagem em destaque em um bloco de capa, controle do tamanho exato da imagem em destaque, suporte para o bloco de galeria e muito mais.<br><strong>Novos blocos</strong>: Comentários, leia mais, sem resultados no loop de consulta, biografia do autor e blocos de avatar.<br><strong>Limitar alterações de bloco</strong>: Opte por desativar a opção de remover um bloco, movê-lo ou ambos.<br><strong>Exportar temas de bloco</strong>: Explore a ferramenta de exportação de tema de bloco aprimorada, à medida que o WordPress se aproxima da construção de tema de bloco visual sem código.<br><strong>API Webfonts</strong>: Gerencie fontes locais com PHP ou theme.json.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Agradecemos os seguintes colaboradores por colaborarem neste artigo: <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">@annezazu</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">@chanthaboune</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\">@marybaum</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/priethor/\">@priethor</a> e <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@webcommsat</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:3:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"WordPress 5.9.3 – Atualização de manutenção\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://br.wordpress.org/2022/04/06/wordpress-5-9-3-atualizacao-de-manutencao/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Apr 2022 02:03:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Lançamentos\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://br.wordpress.org/?p=2435\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:351:\"O WordPress 5.9.3 está disponível!

UpdraftPlus acquired WP-Optimize in 2016 and claims that the tool &#8220;has everything you need to keep your website fast and thoroughly optimized.&#8221; A <a href=\"https://getwpo.com/\">commercial version</a> is also promoted through the free plugin that is hosted on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Tell me, UpdraftPlus, how I&#8217;m supposed to continue trusting your company with my clients&#8217; backups when you use these deceptive and fraudulent practices?&#8221; one customer Adam Lowe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamslowe/status/1564325514319466503\">said</a> in response to Varghese&#8217;s discovery of the plugin not loading JS for performance tools. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Wow, all I can say is what an utter disappointment,&#8221; WordPress agency owner and developer Brian Jackson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of deception is eerily similar to a <a href=\"https://metacoffeedata.com/manipulating-google-lighthouse-results-scam-by-upwork-freelancer/\">scam</a> reported by someone who contracted a performance freelancer on Upwork who artificially manipulated Google Pagespeed results. Others participating in the discussion on Twitter compared it to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal\">Volkswagon emissions scandal</a> where the carmaker was found to activate its emissions controls only during laboratory testing in order to meet the EPA&#8217;s requirements after a violation. The vehicles on the road emitted up to 40 times more nitrogen oxides while driving, as compared to how they performed in the rigged laboratory tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Varghese and several other participants in the conversation concluded that this is why site owners should focus on what real world users are experiencing, instead of performance tool test scores.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hopefully they wonder why their CrUX report data (or better, RUM data) didn\'t budge.

They don&#8217;t expect that a plugin will be hiding JS files from performance tools. Tricking the tests has eroded WP-Optimize&#8217;s credibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Wow. If true, this is as short sighted as it is inexcusable,&#8221; UpdraftPlus customer Johnathon William <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnofhousejohn/status/1563216460737966080\">said</a>. &#8220;And it makes me wonder if I can trust their other product, UpdraftPlus, which I use to backup several client sites.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I contacted UpdraftPlus and lead developer David Anderson said the company was not aware of the issue with the code but related some of the backstory. UpdraftPlus was briefly in talks with the author of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fast-velocity-minify/\">Fast Velocity Minify</a> plugin about the possibility of combining forces, in which he would maintain the minification module within WP-Optimize and gain more users. Ultimately they could not come to an agreement, but during that time WP-Optimize&#8217;s developers forked and adapted Fast Velocity Minify under the GPL. The developers who worked on that adaption are no longer with the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the commit to our own source repository, 2.5 years ago (Jan 2020), the commit was labelled &#8216;Resolve &#8216;Add CSS and JS Minification GPL code from &#8216;Fast Velocity Minify&#8217; &#8211; Part 6&#8242;,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;Part of a series of initial merges of code that was re-factored to be cleaner and use our coding style preferences (but not change any functionality). So the apparent intention of the merge of those lines was to bring over refactored code without at that stage making any changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;According to the commit history (i.e. the &#8216;git blame&#8217; function) no changes have been made to that code since, i.e. it is as-imported. (The history for WP Optimize is public in WordPress SVN too).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a cursory examination of the code, Anderson concluded that his team may need to reexamine it, as they were not aware of what was added two years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As I try to trace that function through the code within the plugins, the intention <strong>on the face of it</strong> appears to be that if the website visitor is a &#8216;bot,&#8217; then code that is pointless for bots won&#8217;t be carried out,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However having said that, 1) the bot names look to be heavily obfuscated/redacted, which is strange (why?), and  2) there are plenty of more obvious bots that aren&#8217;t listed there, such as the Googlebot itself. If that function was being put before me for review today, I&#8217;d certainly question why that is so. I can&#8217;t mind-read myself back 32 months ago, but, I remember it as being a long series of large patches, so it wasn&#8217;t being closely analysed on a line-by-line basis. We knew that we had identified FVM as a good plugin and our main focus was on adapting it to our structure and style, and those were the things I personally was looking at as the final reviewer.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, UpdraftPlus&#8217; development team was not aware of this code until the Twitter thread was published over the weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m certainly glad to have it brought to our intention,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;The associated code comment on a related fragment in its original source that it&#8217;s intended to prevent unnecessary requests for bots, but on a closer examination than that line got at the time, that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll want to look at, as it does look questionable/strange, and we&#8217;ll be doing that by assigning it to a team member who&#8217;s our expert in JavaScript optimizations.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anderson also said that if the JavaScript optimization experts cannot find any legitimate purpose for the code, &#8220;it will certainly be removed,&#8221; with a clear and unambiguous disclosure for the reasoning behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, UpdraftPlus has <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/code-under-investigate-in-wp-optimize/#utm_medium=referral&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_content=social\">published a notice</a> in the plugin&#8217;s support forum to inform users that the code is currently under investigation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To be clear and set users’ minds at rest: the code in question is not dangerous, a virus, an infection, useful to hackers, or anything of that kind,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;The allegation is that its only purpose in existing is effectively to cheat on speed tests. Such code, if so, does not belong in WP Optimize and we will remove it with a new release. Our products’ integrity, and our customers’ trust, are essential for us (and deliberately putting things in open source code that compromises that is, frankly, a stupid thing to do).&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 23:15:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"Matt: Sonic Sphere and Empyrean Gate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=60315\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://ma.tt/2022/08/sonic-sphere-and-empyrean-gate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1266:\"<p>If I had to pick one reason why I&#8217;d suggest every person should attend Burning Man at least once, it would be the art.

For example, the header uses the Cover block featuring a gradient image with the focal point picker set at a certain point. Site identity and navigation are organized within a group, followed by a Media and Text block header section. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon install and activation, Pentatonic delivers a good experience for users. Clicking &#8220;Customize&#8221; takes users to the Site Editor with the front page loaded, looking nearly identical to the demo for the <a href=\"https://fse.catchthemes.com/pentatonic-free/\">free version</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Pentatonic comes with 17 block patterns that users can easily mix and match to create their own unique pages. These include patterns for About Us, Call to Action, Featured Content, Sidebar, Music Podcasts, 404 Header, Archive header, Default footer, Footer with three columns, Default header, Recent with blog sidebar, Post header, Header with buttons, and more. Each section on the homepage can be recreated using a pattern on other pages or repeated/rearranged on the front page.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The theme also includes 11 templates and eight template parts, allowing users to make customizations to the 404 page, blog single posts, search results, post content, and others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pro version of the theme includes access to custom blocks, such as a playlist, case study, skills bar, masonry, popup video, and more. The <a href=\"https://fse.catchthemes.com/pentatonic-pro/\">demo for the pro version</a> has a sticky music player at the bottom of the page, promotional popup video, podcast playlist, and other custom media additions that bands and artists may require.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pentatonic has been optimized to respond well to all screen sizes and looks just as good on mobile as it does on desktop. The theme is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/pentatonic/\">available for free on WordPress.org</a> where you can preview all the patterns and check out a preview of the whole theme in action that strongly resembles the demo hosted on Catch Themes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 21:38:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"Post Status: Post Status Picks for the Week of August 22\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=106891\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-picks-for-the-week-of-august-22/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3533:\"<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-7-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">How to hire or build a diverse team with @Piccia and @UnderRepdInTech • @BobWP on FftF • @heyadamsilver reviews @ForumWP on @kitchensinkwp • @MasterWP on burnout and breaks w/ @Ny_the_Creator • The All Star FSE Outreach Team has a Hallway Hangout on block theming • @TheWPMinute with all the news in 3 minutes and 46 seconds. </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-post-status-podcast-picks\">Post Status Podcast Picks <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f399.png\" alt=\"🎙\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Underrepresented In Tech</strong>: <strong>Piccia Neri</strong> on recruiting and <a href=\"https://www.underrepresentedintech.com/recruiting-applications-and-more-ft-piccia-neri/\">how to hire or build a diverse team</a>.</li><li><strong>Do The Woo</strong>: <strong>Bob Dunn</strong> <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/five-for-the-future-drawing-the-line/\">comments</a> on <strong>Five For The Future</strong> — on giving to the community and also making a living.</li><li><strong>Kitchen Sink WordPress</strong>: A <a href=\"https://kitchensinkwp.com/podcast-e443-forum-plugin-review-6-forumwp/\">review of <strong>ForumWP</strong></a> by <strong>Adam Silver</strong>.</li><li><strong>Press The Issue</strong>: <strong>Rob Howard</strong> and <strong>Nyasha Green</strong> discuss how to <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/presstheissue/taking-a-break/\">avoid burnout</a> and take &#8220;a break.&#8221;</li><li><strong>The WP Minute</strong>: A quick <a href=\"https://the-wp-minute.castos.com/podcasts/23454/episodes/cloudways-with-a-chance-of-digital-ocean\">summary of recent news</a>, including the announcement that <a href=\"https://investors.digitalocean.com/news/news-details/2022/DigitalOcean-to-Acquire-Cloudways/default.aspx\">Digital Ocean Holdings Inc</a>. will be acquiring <strong>Cloudways</strong>. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Video Pick:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Hallway Hangout:</strong> On August 25th, 2022 a few community members from the <strong>Full Site Editing Outreach</strong> program <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z54m9nWjCK0\">joined a call to talk about block theming</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-5 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>Get our weekly WordPress community news digest</strong> — Post Status\' <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress/week-in-review/\">Week in Review</a> — also available in <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/newsletter/\">our newsletter</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f48c.png\" alt=\"💌\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And don\'t miss <strong>the latest updates from the people making WordPress</strong>.

From a development perspective I hope this enables Cloudways to innovate even more in the coming years, but it does immediately pose the question: will DigitalOcean keep their competitors\' hosting services available on Cloudways. All signs point to the same business-as-usual, but only time will truly tell. Regardless, big congrats to Post Status members over there, <strong>Robert Jacobi</strong> and <strong>Zach Stepek</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fränk Klein</strong> over at WordPress agency <strong>Human Made</strong> is asking us to <a href=\"https://humanmade.com/2022/08/24/can-we-please-stop-saying-gutenberg/\">stop saying ‘Gutenberg’.</a> This makes sense. We need to have a consistent vocabulary on how we talk about these things to each other and to stakeholders so we all understand what we’re discussing. I’ve gotten into the habit of saying “the Block Editor” when talking about the new interface for page building in core, but I never thought that we could also break down explaining the various parts to full site editing as well. Human Made does a good job of clarifying all of this, and it might even be a great addition to the WordPress documentation to have all these defined right up front somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of hosting companies, Post Status members <strong>Sam Munoz</strong> and <strong>Brian Gardner</strong> from <strong>WPEngine</strong> have started <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/builders/build-mode-live-july-2022-sessions/\">a regular Zoom meeting</a> called <strong>Build Mode Live</strong> to help anyone with their questions and struggles around full site editing, the block editor, WordPress, and how it all impacts business owners. They’re bringing a design, development, builder, and business owner perspective to an area where we haven’t seen much open discussion. <a href=\"https://calendly.com/bgardner-wpe/build-mode?month=2022-09\">You can sign up to participate right now</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the <strong>Make WordPress Design</strong> blog <strong>Channing Ritter</strong>, Design Director at <strong>Automattic</strong>, shared a reminder that there is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/24/tt3-default-theme-one-week-left-to-submit-style-variations/\">one week left to submit a variation to be included in the new Twenty Twenty Three theme</a> (TT3). There’s a <strong>Figma</strong> file <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/10/twenty-twenty-three-default-theme-project-kickoff/\">attached to Channing\'s kickoff post</a> you can use for the variations. This builds on <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/tech-roundup-for-the-week-of-august-15-2022/\">the tools I shared last week</a> that reinforce the importance of a build flow from Figma to WordPress. All of it is very encouraging! It\'s great to see this process improving.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 id=\"h-cool-tool\">Cool Tool</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each week we’ll feature one cool tool that can help make your life easier as a WordPress builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-theme-palette-1-color has-text-color\"><a href=\"https://wpeditorplus.com\"><span>Editor Plus</span></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you been struggling with the lack of features in the block editor that you’ve grown accustomed to having in a page builder? <a href=\"https://wpeditorplus.com\">That is where <strong>Editor Plus</strong> comes in</a>! It helps you set background, margin, padding, icons, tabs, accordions, ratings, and even animation. I like most that these settings also stay in place even when you switch themes, keeping it from locking you into a specific theme forever. The plugin is led by serial developer <strong>Munir Kamal</strong>, who also runs <strong>Editors Kit</strong> and <strong>Gutenberg Hub</strong>. A bonus for users of this plugin is that there are also a ton of great video tutorials on how to extend Editor Plus to do almost anything.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>\"<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/tech-roundup-for-the-week-of-august-22/\">Tech Roundup for the Week of August 22</a>\" by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/author/schutzsmith/\">Daniel Schutzsmith</a> was first published at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com\">Post Status - The Community for WordPress Professionals</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 16:46:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Daniel Schutzsmith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:128:\"WPTavern: James Koster Shares Design Explorations that Transform WordPress’ Site Editor Into a More Visual, User-Friendly Tool\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137360\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"https://wptavern.com/james-koster-shares-design-explorations-that-transform-wordpress-site-editor-into-a-more-visual-user-friendly-tool\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4026:\"<p>Automattic-sponsored designer James Koster has a vision for taking WordPress&#8217; Site Editor from its beta awkwardness and transforming it to become a more visual and user-friendly design tool. In a recent post titled <a href=\"https://jameskoster.design/2022/08/24/revising-the-presentation-of-key-site-editor-features/\">Revising the presentation of key Site Editor features</a>, Koster identifies unbalanced feature weighting as a critical design flaw that is negatively impacting users&#8217; experience with the editor:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The Site Editor is a powerful tool, but the user experience lacks some coherence and a sense of hierarchy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Template management and editing has central focus, despite the fact that it’s a product area that has proven difficult for some users to interpret.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Impactful features like style and menu management are hierarchically relegated, and consequently deliver a sub-optimal UX.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I’ve been ideating on how we might present site editor features with more appropriate weighting, so that the overall experience feels more like a design tool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of dropping users directly into editing the homepage, Koster contends that the Site Editor&#8217;s design should be updated to become a &#8220;navigable frame&#8221; where users can select from a menu of features and styles on the left. This is a radical improvement over the current experience, which feels like walking into a room with all the lights on and multiple features competing for attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The combination of the site frame (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/23328\">Browse mode</a>) and one-click editing helps to obfuscate some of the aforementioned confusion around template editing,&#8221; Koster said. &#8220;Now you simply browse to the page you want to update, and click ‘Edit’.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another idea Koster explored is a view that makes it easier to understand the interaction of styles and templates. The UI is much cleaner and drastically reduces the cognitive load for users who are struggling to grasp the concept of templates in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Identity and homepage configuration options haven&#8217;t found a place in the site editor yet. Koster proposed bringing them into the editor in a similar fashion to how it was previously presented in the Customizer, with live previews.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Koster also proposes organizing features like templates, template parts, reusable blocks, and patterns in a &#8220;Design Library&#8221; section, presented via a grid of thumbnails that would open the edit view. This would bring a new level of organization to a set of tools that are currently scattered throughout the site editor interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a few highlights from his explorations. Although Koster articulates many of the Site Editor&#8217;s current pain points, his designs present an elegant solution for each. Check out the <a href=\"https://jameskoster.design/2022/08/24/revising-the-presentation-of-key-site-editor-features/\">full post</a> to see all the videos and other ideas for organizing features in the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The disparity between the current experience and Koster&#8217;s mockups is like a night and day Cinderella style transformation. It&#8217;s a powerful example of how thoughtful design can really solve problems. His explorations received positive feedback from those eager to see these designs implemented in Gutenberg. Koster said his next step is to prepare some simpler prototypes for collaboration on GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The ideas are still formative, but with some pruning we can get things into a shippable state,&#8221; Koster said. &#8220;My next step is to refine and prototype a more stripped-back version, and take that to GitHub for wider thoughts and feedback.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 15:13:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Post Status: A Taxonomy of Access Control\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=106756\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://poststatus.com/a-taxonomy-of-access-control/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3219:\"<p><strong>Bruce Schneier </strong><a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/08/a-taxonomy-of-access-control.html#comments\">thinks this idea</a> from <strong>Ittay Eyal</strong> is brilliant and broadly applicable. Since I like pretty much everything Bruce says (that I can understand) I tried to get my head around this and <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519\">the discussion it spawned</a> in <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519\">Post Status Slack</a> with <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519\">Rowley</a> and <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C02M81N9YEM/p1660856386106519\">JJJ</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bruce\'s summary:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The paper is about cryptocurrency wallet design, but the ideas are more general. Ittay points out that a key—or an account, or anything similar—can be in one of four states:<br /><br /><strong>safe</strong> Only the user has access,<br /><strong>loss</strong> No one has access,<br /><strong>leak</strong> Both the user and the adversary have access, or<br /><strong>theft</strong> Only the adversary has access.</p><p>Once you know these states, you can assign probabilities of transitioning from one state to another (someone hacks your account and locks you out, you forgot your own password, etc.) and then build optimal security and reliability to deal with it. It’s a truly elegant way of conceptualizing the problem.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I think of it more like this, since it\'s how most people actually operate:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Secure:</strong> Only I have access (as far as I know)<ul><li><strong>Strong Secure:</strong> Proper strong, unique passwords, 2FA</li><li><strong>Weak Secure:</strong> Weak, reused passwords, no 2FA (OK for trivial sites that require a login, bad for your bank account.)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Loss:/Lockout</strong> No one has access</li><li><strong>Shared:</strong> I and designated others have access, which could easily become:<ul><li><strong>Leak:</strong> Undesignated, unknown others have access, which could easily become:<ul><li><strong>Theft/Breach</strong>: An adversary has access <ul><li><strong>Theft and Lockout:</strong> An adversary has access and may have broadly leaked or shared access with others, but I am locked out.</li><li><strong>Theft and No Lockout:</strong> My account has been hacked but I can still get in. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid Sharing/Leaking with strong secure accounts, and the probability of theft/breach is much, much lower. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/08/a-taxonomy-of-access-control.html\">A Taxonomy of Access Control</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>\"<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/a-taxonomy-of-access-control/\">A Taxonomy of Access Control</a>\" by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/author/dan-knauss/\">Dan Knauss</a> was first published at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com\">Post Status - The Community for WordPress Professionals</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Aug 2022 14:42:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Do The Woo Community: Woo Stories, They are Everywhere\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72682\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://dothewoo.io/woo-stories-they-are-everywhere/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:383:\"<p>Every product or site WooCommerce builder has a story to tell whether they are a developer, designer or anything between. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;

Giving, making, creating&#8230; Looking at the search results for  &#8220;Make WordPress&#8221; and &#8220;the firehose&#8221; of Make WordPress Slack where the #docs channel was having their weekly meeting, Dan and Ny look at the wide range of options there are for new contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><em>I would say you\'re contributing by learning. Like if you\'re, if you\'re learning in community, that\'s a step deeper in.</em></p><cite>Dan Knauss</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentoring and organizing Meetups is a topic that comes up again. That\'s where Ny feels she has been given the most and most enjoys giving back. However, there are barriers to getting people engaged with the WordPress project — and to work for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan asks what needs to be done to reach younger people. Ny talks about the barriers from a BIPOC perspective, where sensitivity to history and personal stories matters. Dan relates that to an inner city gardening project he volunteered with that had an all-white leadership team. If contributing is a privilege, how can we help elevate more people to that level of privilege?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also covered:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How does the older open source culture of contribution (not) translate to the contemporary culture of the &#8220;creator economy?&#8221;</li><li>Dan\'s initial experience with trying to onboard himself in #docs.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-10 wp-block-columns sponsor has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"Cloudways\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-8 wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"sponsor-wpengine\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/cloudways\">Cloudways</a><a href=\"https://poststat.us/wpengine\"></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Cloudways</strong> </strong>is proud to sponsor Post Status.

How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> All right. It\'s an earlier one than, than we usually do, but that\'s good. Start the day. Um, yeah, so I thought we could, we could talk about, um, contribution and contributors and, and what that means in the, in the word. community where, um, I don\'t know, you, we probably both have about the same level of outside in kind of experience with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, I\'m not the expert or anything, but, um, mm-hmm, , I could tell you what my, my experience is and how I\'m, I\'m looking at that. And some of the discussions that are going on about what it, what contribution means or could mean. And, um, Yeah, how\'s that sound? What\'s what\'s yours? What is it? What comes to mind when, when you hear that word in the [00:01:00] WordPress context?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, I guess, uh, the same it\'s, it\'s the same when I hear it in like, you know, outside in life contribution means giving back. It means helping, it means providing, um, and, uh, you know, it\'s the same in WordPress. So definitely down to talk about this today, and I\'m very interested to hear your thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, it\'s I, I think it\'s, um, it\'s the core part of the, the project that is the oldest, um, feature of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The oldest foundations of it, that\'s very, very open source, very old, um, old part of open. As Matt has said in, in some talks, like give a penny, take a penny kind of, kind of ethic. Um, really kind of going back, I guess, to like Linux and the seventies [00:02:00] and early and earlier generation. And I wonder sometimes if like after millennials or so if, if that\'s things have changed a lot and that\'s not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understood. There\'s kind of a, a reciprocity there. You use the software, it\'s free. It\'s open. Um, how are, how can you, the more you get engaged with it as a user, as a developer, um, someone maybe profiting from it. How, how do you give back and does that, does that just happen naturally through the relationships that arise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or not. And how do we move really? How do we move the, the project forward? And, um, I was just looking this morning. Like if you, if you, um, I was, I was just Googling make WordPress. So there\'s the whole make.wordpress.org, um, page where you get the list of all the core core teams and, um, [00:03:00] If you search for make WordPress, you get three ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, first for WP engines, WordPress page builder, wordpress.com WordPress page builder element, or for WordPress, create it with Elementor, um, the create and build language. So, uh, most people these days, um, and, and they\'re targeting what people wanna do. Uh, how do you just make something with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create and build. But I\'m looking for the old school. How do I contribute back? Where, where the you\'re budding developer designer, just helping, like helping out. We\'re always looking for people to help make WordPress even better. Um, and there, what you can give back goes into all these teams that, uh, we now have a performance team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hasn\'t changed a ton. It\'s, it\'s rare for them to add. So we got the core and that\'s really like the fundamental. Thing here, if we don\'t move word breast core [00:04:00] forward, how much does anything else matter? But there\'s so much else people can give and do that really is essential too. You don\'t don\'t want to deemphasize that design mobile mobile team is now been more explicitly defined as that\'s open source that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s not, um, that\'s not something that is tied to jet pack or.com. And you, you wanna work on iOS and Android apps, Java objective C swift. Um, that\'s a, that\'s a whole nother section accessibility. Polyglots multilingual, uh, translation, WordPress support, uh, support forums. What,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> uh, what stands out to you the most out of all of those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, what do you think? Like, not what\'s most important, but, um, cuz that\'s subjective. Um, which one would you be like most interested in contributing to? Yeah. Which one do you think speaks to you the most? When you read through the list? [00:05:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And I was, I was, I\'ve been thinking about that. So then there\'s documentation and that\'s where I\'ve been trying to kind of learn, figure out how to get in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s, that\'s kind of where it, it isn\'t that easy. It isn\'t that easy. maybe, you know, some people or if you have a deeper connection, but from that straight outside in it\'s it\'s tricky documentation, themes, plugins, community. Training test TV marketing, CLI WordPress CLI the VP CLI uh, hosting tide, open verse photos for performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there\'s really a lot of different skill sets that could be attractive. And a lot of things you could do, but to be honest, the, um, my, my experience is, um, I haven\'t really done like. Contribution in the form of little patches and bug reports and stuff since way back, like, you know, they\'re still using tra have you, do you have much SVN experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that\'s what we were all using like 20 years [00:06:00] ago on source project. WordPress is still using. Um, so, so yeah, there\'s all these, all these different teams that are maybe attractive to different skill sets you may have or different people, um, May have, and, um, core is really at the center of it. And there\'s all, all these other things orbiting around that, um, or orbiting around the community and, and serving it or around mobile app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and yeah, finding your way into it, I think is, is. Is the trick. Um, once someone gets interested in, in doing that and bringing, bringing new folks in and smoothing the onboarding, um, is probably, um, something we need to pay more attention to. It\'s tough. I, Brian mm-hmm Brian cords was, was writing about [00:07:00] that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did he, um, So he, he talks about his experience. I\'m, I\'m kind of doing the same thing. Try, can I put in a few hours a week, I\'ve been trying to follow, just look at the docs program, you know, cause writing, editing that\'s mm-hmm, , that\'s probably the easiest thing for me. I\'ve I\'ve done little bug reports and patches and, and things before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I go back a long way. So SVN or, you know, was something I was using way before GitHub existed get was a thing. Um, but it\'s, it\'s. It\'s quite amazed of, of things and a lot of customs and etiquettes and rituals, parts of the culture to, to understand, um, to get started. So I feel like there\'s like a long watching, reading, learning, asking questions, maybe getting mentored, um, phase you have to go through, um, have you taken a look at like the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would make [00:08:00] WordPress slack at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I have not. And I\'m going to be completely honest. Um, I will eventually, I am just in so many slack channels right now. I don\'t think I can. I don\'t think I can possibly take on that one. Um, I\'ve heard it\'s it\'s a lot. I, I just cannot do it. I\'m in like work slacks. I have like my mentoring slacks that I do official mentoring with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have like slacks I was in before I, um, got. Um, tech and I still help people there. I just, uh, if I join one more, I think my head will explode. Yeah. But please enlighten me to what usually goes on</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> here. Well, I\'m not an expert, I\'m trying to figure out the same as you and, and, and Brian and, um, yeah, I think the reality is, is yet they call it the fire hose for reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, it\'s probably, one of the busiest slacks and consistently for so long, this major, um, Of [00:09:00] information and cooperation. Um, so it\'s daunting, it\'s intimidating to, um, to look at how to get into, um, but it there\'s there\'s method to the madness and what I\'ve learned, just kind of following along and looking at, at things in a, in a pretty traditional way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I assume the. Other teams work like this, but like docs. Um, we have a, um, a meeting every Tuesday morning at this time. So 8, 8, 8 am. I\'m kind of following, um, on my phone here and people kind of check in. I can make it, I can\'t make it. Um, melanic cap is, um, one, the leader there and one of the leaders and you\'d probably like her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\'s a ump developer. Um, who\'s kind an advocate. For PHP as well. Who\'s been doing docs for a long time. So you developer literacy is really important if you\'re gonna write [00:10:00] docs and guides for, for things that directly deal with that. But there\'s so much else you don\'t have to be. You don\'t have to have any particular code depth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s so much other documentation going on. Um, and that\'s probably starting to overlap some with the training materials that are another team. That\'s a. Newer thing that will help onboard people, I think, to have training and then also mentoring happening all these meetups that are relatively new, um, community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Is that I\'m not sure what group that\'s what if that\'s happening under the community team? I think that\'s all that\'s under the training team. Mm-hmm uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> what the meetups,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> oh, that you\'re talking about. Yeah. They\'re make they\'re they\'re coming out of the core. So they\'re, there are, um, Hannah tab. For this somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Organizing the meetups, which is what I\'m doing in [00:11:00] Columbia, South Carolina. And I always say the city and not the state and Charlotte, North Carolina, mm-hmm um, falls more under community. We\'ve been all over there. Yeah. Trying to get things, uh, settled for it. Um, that\'s that\'s my area of export.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expertise, but it\'s still really, really hard. Um, , I I\'ve, I\'ve organized a lot of things and this might be the hardest honestly. And I don\'t know if, if it\'s, you know, because it\'s so specialized or what, but, um, still really excited. And I just I\'m, I just can\'t wait to, you know, have that set up as my contribution and like spread it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s like my goal for it. Yeah. That</p>\n\n\n\n<p>would</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Def that would be under, under community. Um, Yeah, it\'s actually is I guess, something you could get into and start doing in your own, um, in your own city and a lot happens outside of slack, outside of, um, Outside of this, but that there\'s the community team. And mm-hmm</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was, I was speaking of, um, the, the newer meetups that [00:12:00] are sponsored by learn, um, WordPress. So there\'s, there\'s probably some increasing overlap between community and training, which is a good thing. There, there are all these meetups that are happening as virtual. Um, there\'s a schedule, there\'s a calendar on here where people like, um, um, People who are directly involved in working on Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, uh, Nick Diego, I saw I had had one coming up, um, uh, will be doing live workshops so you can go and get, get some knowledge from, from people who are directly working on, um, on newer parts of, of WordPress and. so some of that is higher, higher level stuff for, um, developers, designers, and some of it is oriented towards people who might be really new to using WordPress in different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So training\'s [00:13:00] close to mentoring and close to community building. So that\'s kind of a neat area where, um, where people can. Brought in and, um, connected. And I would say you\'re contributing by learning. Like if you\'re, if you\'re learning in community, , that\'s like step in mm-hmm um, for a lot of people, um, I noticed that, so we have this weekly thing that Daniel Chut Smith is doing, um, for us where he\'s rounding up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, What\'s going on and what\'s catching his eye, uh, design and development. And this, his last Roundup was mostly stuff coming from.org from make, create your first app with Gutenberg data. So using react. Um, so Adams Linsky put together a nice tutorial. That\'s showing you how to do that. That\'s a link to, um, developer, the developer section of word, wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block theme builders, Figma [00:14:00] of building a workflow from Figma Figma to your block theme. You\'re trying to create, that\'s a learn WordPress online workshop. So that\'s, that\'s one of these things I\'m talking about. That\'s a meet up. So, um, you can sign up and, and do that. There that\'s an intermediate level for an audience of builders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So people who may not be high, um, Deep into code, um, high level development stuff. That\'s okay. This is, um, working from Figma to your block template. Are you, are you doing anything, any front end stuff like that, or mostly have these database backend projects you\'re working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'m doing everything. But, um, mostly right now I am working with the database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, mostly when I talk to my mentors and they want me to show them, like, I always get the question. Uh, can you show me what you do at work or a day in the life of you? Mm-hmm and, um, I don\'t show them my [00:15:00] calendar. I don\'t wanna scare them away, but, um, uh, usually it\'s front end work with them, um, because that\'s what, you know, they learn first and most are interested in, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, I have not gotten away from front end work because that\'s the first thing that newbies wanna see. Oh yeah. How it works in WordPress. And I think, uh, WordPress is great for front end development. So that\'s my way of trying to get them into the community as well. So I throw in my community stuff like, Hey, you know, we\'re gonna have meet up soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to come and learn more about the community and that\'s my sales pitch. And that\'s how I, that\'s how I get. That\'s how I\'m getting people into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. It\'s great to see that there\'s so many levels like, yeah, we\'re gonna reach out to builders, to people who are totally new to it, to people are maybe doing freelance or agency work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I was hinting earlier, like when you, if you search for this, like the way that, the way that a lot of companies, including, um, wordpress.com and automatic or. [00:16:00] Presenting WordPress to the world is to the creator economy and to, to people, I just wanna build something. I wanna start my business online. I, and, and their first thought is I don\'t not to understand anything about open source or that there\'s a community behind that or what, that, that, there\'s this, uh, culture of contribution and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s a long, that\'s a long way up later. Mm-hmm and , I wrote something where I, I, I feel like, you know, we really have. Embrace that. And I see that happening on the marketing level, on the commercial side to a lot of WordPress companies. Um, and I, I even noticed like, as, as the.com, um, I, when they did their first price change, I got the bargain and I up upgraded my longstanding account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a.blog blog and a bunch of other sites there. And. Um, you can, there\'s the marketplace there. You can install and do a lot in.com. Now you can install Elementor I\'ve not seen that [00:17:00] before. So you could, you could pop that in on wordpress.com and start building with that if you want. And they\'re very oriented towards a, a builder, um, creator economy approach, but getting people inside is like the key thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, however you come, however you come, come, as you are. I think like that needs to be more of. Our approach. And as cuz people aren\'t gonna, the average person, isn\'t gonna go to.org, the make thing there, and look at these core teams and, and, and go like, okay. Yeah. I, I see where I fit. Like I, you and I would, would struggle with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like it\'s gonna, it\'s gonna take weeks and, and months to probably get, um, to get comfortable. And that\'s, that\'s cool. That\'s fine. That\'s how you build relationships, but it\'s not. It\'s not like on the instant gratification level of, let me build my site today, which you wanna do as quickly as as you can. Um, [00:18:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I think it\'s even, um, even for people like me who will sit down and take their time, um, when things are presented to them, It\'s so much to go through sometimes depending on what you want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And like you said, like it\'s not an easy thing to jump into. It\'s it\'s making that time too. I know, like for me right now, I get asked every week, like, how are you doing everything you do? And sometimes, I don\'t know, but, um, like. I think it\'s easier for me to still contribute because like, I, I didn\'t go into this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, Hey, I have to make myself fit to one of these. I went into this as, this is what I already do. This is something I\'m good at, how can I connect this with WordPress? So I think that\'s an easier way. And then like that allowed me to like, okay, I can make time to, you know, set this. I have a partner helping me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Ken, yeah. Elliot is helping, um, well, he\'s the mastermind. I\'m helping him. Um, and, um, I think that\'s a easier way, but I agree with you a hundred percent. [00:19:00] Um, that\'s, you know, just when you were reading them off, I\'m like, this is a lot. And then when you get into them, it\'s like, you have to break it down and that\'s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think if we have like more. I guess people like me or you cuz you did it too. When you talked about how, you know, you\'re a writer and documentation probably would be your strongest point and you\'ve done some of it before. I think people getting people like us to talk to people and say, well, this is how we did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would definitely help people a lot because it\'s a little overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. It, it is. And yeah. Well, if what I, what I found is that it\'s probably your own sense of, um, my own sense of in, in, uh, you don\'t want to be ask of the dumb question, but, or, you know, You have to put yourself out there. So they\'re very encouraging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like who\'s got questions who needs help. You know, you, you, people will take the time and, and show you. And I\'ve, I\'ve got like an accumulated list of tabs and, and links where I need to, I need to take some time and watch this UN WordPress TV. Right. I need to read through this and figure it out. [00:20:00] I, um, a couple weeks ago, I, you know, figured out how they\'re using good Gutenberg on, um, GitHub, a little deeper and, and how to, um, How to submit, um, changes on, uh, there\'s there\'s documentation, that\'s written into code, uh, in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, and sometimes it\'s wrong or, or changes. So you have to, you have to actually commit, um, changes to comments that are embedded in PHP code somewhere. Um, Things like that there\'s a wide range of, of stuff, but how all these workflows and things work and it just takes some time to, to learn. And it\'s, it\'s pretty satisfying once you figure it out and you are like, okay, I fixed, I fixed that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, it definitely</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> is. Yeah. And in the process you might find some more bugs or things and stuff like that to, to put in. Um, but just a little here and there is, is, um, is really a good thing. [00:21:00] Um, I, I. People on the whole are, are really welcoming. It is, it is just getting past that fire hose and here, here\'s what I need to forget all that other stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s what I need to focus on. And it\'s probably cool doing the meetups or mentoring, which, um, is gonna become more and more a part of the training and community. I, um, I don\'t have, I\'d like to get more details on this, but I, I see SFA has been, been saying things about mentoring as. Becoming a more explicit form of contribution, mentoring, how to do word camps and, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And mm-hmm , and that they, there is probably some mentoring program coming down the line, along with training. So if you\'re doing, you want to go and do, um, a meetup, um, tutorial of some kind or do that in the context of your own meetups, totally contributing. And then I that\'s, that\'s probably accessible to a lot of people cuz most of the work is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gonna be, I would assume relationships and [00:22:00] stuff like in your community. So you don\'t like, you don\'t start from slack, you don\'t start from, from all that. That\'s kind of where you go to maybe get support. And, um, the main, the main thing is really the people stuff. So if that\'s, that\'s what turns you on and, and motivates you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah, that\'s totally essential contributing out there in. Real life relationships, um, locally where you\'re, you\'re starting. How\'s that going with? Um, Greenville and, um, or green wait, Greensboro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> no, not Greenville. Um, not Greensboro. Um, I think you\'re, you\'re getting me nice or green mixed up with those I\'m I\'m joking. Um, so char Charlotte and Columbia. Okay. I don\'t know where Columbia .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Go ahead. Sorry. I used Greenville in my head like Greenville, South Carolina, you know, I used to live [00:23:00] in Raleigh mm-hmm Durham, chapel hill area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually. I don\'t know if you know that area that well, Carrie and Carrie and table mm-hmm . Yeah. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah, I, I really love that area actually. Um, uh, you, uh, now there was a, uh, Greenville, uh, WordPress meetup for a long time. Um, and I think like a lot of people in Columbia, even though there was one in Columbia at one point, I think a lot of people in Columbia had to go to Greenville for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you may be thinking about that. Cuz Greenville, I think had a longer, a one that lasted longer than ours. In Columbia. Um, but we\'re right now, if we were to start one in Columbia, to my knowledge, cuz I always check out Greenville, Columbia, Charleston, the big major cities, to my knowledge, we would be the only one in the state right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m gonna double check on that. But the last I checked a few months ago. Yeah, we would be the only one. So I. It definitely would help. And like, we really want to spread the knowledge because Columbia\'s in the, in the middle of the state. Right. That\'s why I chose Columbia, not just because I [00:24:00] was from there, but it\'s in the middle of the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm, , we\'re an hour and a half to almost anywhere in the state, maybe two max. And so if people have to make that drive, which, you know, if they can, that\'s fine. If they can, we still wanna do it, uh, in a way that will. You know, semi virtual and recording recorded. So we\'re setting that up as well. Um, cuz we know South Carolina is very rural and we don\'t have great public transportation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, it\'s really going to help a lot because it\'s going to reach all throughout our state, which is not known for tech at all, Charleston and Greenville, more Southern Columbia. So. It\'s going to help a lot and it\'s going really, really well. Um, we have a place, um, we have food, uh, so many different companies reached out to me because they saw what I was doing and wanted to help goad wants to feed us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, my company master WP wants to feed us and master WP is actually sponsoring our, um, sponsoring us and taking care of our venue. Um, we [00:25:00] have people offering to send us. Things to give out to newbies. Um, I have Courtney Robertson, which is, she\'s been such a great help who has just offered to give out so many learning materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Um, I ju just the outpouring of support and then we can take that and spread it. It\'s just been, it\'s been a community effort, so it definitely meetups are definitely community. I see why it\'s under that label and I\'m just so excited. Like I\'m going to like spam everyone\'s Twitter when. You know, get up and running and we have pictures and video and things like that because, um, I think, you know, I agree with Josepha Josepha is really, really great to talk to, and I love how she answers questions and it\'s always very transparent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, it\'s, it\'s awesome that she\'s going to expand that because we can definitely take these materials and, you know, help with that and make sure people can do it in their states. Maybe their states don\'t have any work camp meetups or WordPress meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. There\'s probably, uh, It\'d be interesting to look at a, a Pinboard, you know, [00:26:00] map of, you know, where we, where there\'s activity and yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some are very established and been around a long time. Some come and go. The, I know the local Edmonton one. Um, yeah, pretty much ended just around the time I, I moved here. There\'s one in there\'s, one in Calgary. Um, and I\'ve talked with some people there about, about all that. Um, you know, it, it\'s a, it\'s a takes a lot to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get things, uh, rolling again, but there\'s wherever you go, there\'s kind of an existing WordPress builder community. I, I, I sense there\'s a lot of people freelancing or, and there\'s a bunch of agencies and my, this was true even when, before WordPress was that adopted probably at that level. And I was doing more with, um, with June law and some other DRAL and other, other CMS, um, related things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That a lot of people just get in to scratch their rich and build something. And, and then they [00:27:00] start doing that as a job and maybe they develop an agency or something. And so there\'s, there\'s a bunch of people who are like an unorganized, the lump and proletariat of word press, who are like, uh, they\'re not organized into, um, into a, a regular meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly. Um, but the potential is there mm-hmm , maybe it comes in and goes at at times, cuz there there\'re people who would fit the kind of WordPress professional or the line between the hazy line amateur and, and professional and doing this for myself and or which often turns into this is my job. Um, but it\'s, it\'s often secondary and I think that\'s an, that\'s been tough for the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project. And I wonder if there\'s, if there\'s a, that\'s kind of where contributor language gets gets complicated. And I wonder if we should like focus more on creativity and creation and there\'s all these people who are sort of [00:28:00] on the outer edges, who, who are very versed, inward press or using it in some significant way, but they haven\'t really connected deeper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Into the community. And they\'re definitely contributing in the sense of, um, teaching and informing and expanding the market and expanding the brand, but, um, how they find their way into. These other, um, layers of the onion towards core contribution. Um, it\'s, it\'s tough cause you don\'t wanna make it sound like, well, what you\'re doing isn\'t worth as much mm-hmm um, cause it it\'s as they\'re all different, but to drive things forward, you do need people to come in who get more of that kinda leadership level to organize, meet up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentor people, um, submit patches, um, get involved in, [00:29:00] in actual software development, which yeah. Is hard not to, not to privilege. Cause that\'s really a key, that\'s what we\'re all using. That\'s what either falls behind or, or innovates and yeah. What do, what do you think about that? Do you, are you think there\'s ways in our language that can be kind of offputting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it\'s like this inner circle of, of people who give back and are. Are you adequate is it can maybe be an easy feeling of, uh, of inadequacy or imposter syndrome that\'s RI and, and things, and, and that language can kinda land heavily on, on you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh, yeah, definitely. Um, especially, you know, that\'s something that goes beyond tech, but, um, when we\'re talking specifically about us right here. Yeah. That can be off putting you. You have to think. Um, I do a lot of community service. because that\'s just how I am. That\'s just how I was raised. That\'s just me as a person, but I\'m smart enough also to acknowledge [00:30:00] it\'s tough to get people to work for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it\'s tough. Um, that\'s something that\'s drilled that was drilled into my head from, um, From a young age. And we talked a little bit about that on one of our other podcasts, like how American slavery, like is affecting people to this day. And it\'s like, there\'s no way anybody in my family from the oldest members, my great aunts to the youngest, my little baby niece, none of them would just sit and smile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I told them I was working, doing anything for free outside of C. Help. So , and it\'s like, it doesn\'t even have to be that deep for a lot of people. People are just not working for free mm-hmm, , we\'re in a very capitalist society. Um, we, things cost money. You know, things are high right now. Um, but again, not even getting that deep, it\'s just hard for some people to just work for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also for people who want to do it time. Time is such a big constraint. So you may have people that are out there. They\'re like, I wanna do this. Yeah. But I [00:31:00] don\'t know how I wanna do this. And I don\'t have the time. And now these people are telling me that I\'m not enough. If I\'m not doing this, man, I\'m not doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, I, I see how it can lead there. Um, I, I, I definitely see that. Um, sometimes, you know, I, I it\'s, it, it is, it does seem like that at times, but it\'s just going to depend on you as a person, like stuff like that. Won\'t bother me personally, because if I can\'t do something, I can\'t do it. Yeah. I don\'t have the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t have the time, but I, I get it. I definitely get it. Um, I, I\'m not sure though how. I\'m not sure how to pull people in, who may be feeling that like it, they may have that imposter syndrome now. Um, is there just like extra reassurance? What do you think? What, what do you think could be clarified in the language to get those, to, to kind of pull those people back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I think that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> the more channels, the more way, ways in the, the better off you are, if it, I feel like in the past, it\'s [00:32:00] like, that\'s the only thing, like.org make page. You either figure out how to get into a team here, you hit the support forum. You, you, you find you come in through some local group. Um, there are only a couple, couple ways to do it and it, uh, it is all in this open source contribution code, committing focus, and that\'s become less and less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that was alwa that\'s always, always been a subculture and it\'s become probably more and more of one. um, I think younger generations too, are in a totally different space in because it\'s social, um, realities, like, I don\'t know how much we\'ve really addressed that. I mean, there are long term prolonged economic contraction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, not everyone\'s doing that. Mm-hmm well, emotionally. With stable income and employment. Mm-hmm [00:33:00] you can\'t assume stuff like that there, it we\'ve been through the most stressful. Yeah. I, I don\'t know if we\'re really through it, you know, like you turn on the news and it people all around the world. And even in, in places that are, are fairly affluent it\'s, there\'s a lot, there\'s a lot more stress and tension in, in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people have lost, uh, friends and loved ones either, you know? They\'re no longer living. Um, that happens normally, but we just pandemic. Um, there\'s but there\'s so many, especially as you have a community to ages and, and goes along. I, I think a lot of us who\'ve been in there a long time. Um, there\'s time of life things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, I, it would be more sensitive to that all. And, and what you\'re saying too about. there\'s cultural and, and definitely racial differences that I think are hard to see from the outside. You\'re making me think of, um, mm-hmm, how the, a [00:34:00] good metaphor for this is when I, one of the things I did, I did a ton of, I lived in a part of Milwaukee that was, um, and otherwise it\'s very second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe people would say an apartheid city that has some. Entrenched in difficult problems and living in one of really the only area that\'s, that\'s fairly mixed and, and diverse is volunteerism is a key thing there. And it\'s tough. People don\'t have necessarily have a bunch, but there\'s this huge. They don\'t necessarily have the means or whatever, but they.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s just such a drive to do community projects together and fix stuff. And gardening became more and more community gardens and stuff like that. Victory gardens. Yeah. Well, when I first started doing that, I was, um, I was doing it with, uh, uh, a church that had an interesting history. And so we had mostly African American kids coming to the summer program and, and trying to make a.[00:35:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lots of vacant lots where stuff has been torn down or burned down over the years and in my neighborhood there. And, um, trying to build a, make a garden and, um, this same, it, it it\'s, it wasn\'t so much the work for free, cuz we, it was all hitched up to, um, You you come and you work on this, you get paid a certain kind of gift allowance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we like try to explain banking and like walk down the street to the, the local bank on Martin Luther king drive. And like, this is how money works and like save a little. And , uh, give a little back and, and think about what your long term plans are for what you want to get. It was, it was honestly very white, middle class kind of skiing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>very good in very good intentions, but the first barrier is, um, these are kids who have like zero, um, [00:36:00] there in that area. Um, Their, their experience is all urban for, um, probably one or two generations. But before that down the Mississippi deep south, not a good agricultural experience share, you know, share cropping, you know, extended forms of Neo slavery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, you know, until grandparents, parents came up in the fifties, forties, fifties, and got the last of the good industrial jobs before that all went, went in part. Um, so, mm. I realized and read some things. Um, I never read something. I can\'t remember who it was, but there was a, there was a local guy and then someone else rare, uh, voices of African Americans who got on the land and were farming got, you know, as free farmers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people came all the way up here in Alberta and did that Canada. And it\'s not the typical voice. And they talked about how hard it is to do. [00:37:00] Things like with the land, from an African American perspective, cuz there\'s such an alienation from it some of the time. And so these kids, oh yeah, they would not wear, like they didn\'t have grungy clothes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They would wear like their best white brand new shoes. Like, you know, they didn\'t want to get messed up. It was really hard to get people like, get your hands down in, in this. And then like, remember kids would say like, you all look like a bunch of slaves. Like this is a huge barrier. Here cuz there\'s not an ability to imagine us working and doing this free labor in any other way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And like who\'s in charge, the white guys like, like, yeah, it totally looks, it totally looks that way. So,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> um, yeah. Yeah. It that\'s a good, that is a good way to put that. Sorry, that that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> really story. Cause you can express that in a way that is accusatory. and make, you know, make us feel really bad, but, um, but it\'s totally valid and, and [00:38:00] there was a disconnect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the only way I found around that was like individual relationships and getting like over a couple years and getting to know some of these kids is they were growing up and like they in doing other things with them, like I found a, a bunch of the young men, um, like they never went over to east side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s dangerous. You can\'t go over there and there\'s nothing there that we would be interested in and, you know, broadening people\'s sense of their own freedom and capacity. Yeah, you actually, we can go over here. There\'s some cool stuff and food you like and, um, people who, uh, are friendly. So it, I think that kind of everyone does that everyone has their little comfort zone that probably needs to be expand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the same time, those walls exist, cuz people have been hurt or they\'ve, um, or there\'s something in their history where they see this as a wall that is defended and is dangerous to push [00:39:00] or they, they sense on some level like this is gonna, um, this isn\'t what I should, this isn\'t for me, this isn\'t my people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s just huge that\'s people stuff. We have to find, find ways to make many ways through and in. Um, cuz if you keep trying something that doesn\'t work, that turns people off, it doesn\'t matter how right. You think you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh yeah, you\'re right on the money with that. And. just relating that back to WordPress. Imagine those kids that you were, uh, you know, trying to get to do that with. And they\'re like, God, like not saying, this is their attitude, but say they walked away with that saying mm-hmm they were trying to get us to do free labor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were trying to get us do free work. That\'s crazy. And then they. um, they, you know, they get older and they learn code and they learn tech. And they\'ve heard that tech is just this, this freedom and it\'s this place to make money. And it\'s just like, you can elevate, I can elevate my life and they get to tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the first thing they see is people saying, Hey, if you wanna be a [00:40:00] great person in this community, you need to do some free work. They all like what? Like they might freak out like what in the world? Why is everybody want me to do free, free labor and, um, that\'s, you know, that\'s just relating that back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s it\'s sometimes that\'s. A red flag to people. It\'s definitely a red flag to me. Um, because also people are still exploiting people of color women. Um, people who are disabled, they are still getting exploited for low wages or free labor to this day. So that\'s still something we have to look out for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve been asked to do free labor many times, and I\'ve had to politely tell people like, no, I\'m not doing that. Or, you know, and depending on. What the situation is, maybe talk to others, like what\'s going on. Like I have to teach my mentors not to accept like, well, this job, they really gonna gimme the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They said, okay, me an exposure and experience. And then one day I\'ll be a big developer. No. Do not let people do that to you. That\'s like, I, I always tell people like, no, [00:41:00] you, you deserve to be paid. Now you deserve to be paid fair and adequately. So we don\'t have to go back too far. It\'s happening today. Um, so of course people are calling it out more and people are looking at it as a red flag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hate that people see it as a red flag in WordPress. Uh, some people. Inmate WordPress and giving back. And then I hate that some people just, you know, don\'t have the time and they\'re turned off by, you know, phrasing about it because it\'s, it\'s a privilege to have free time. Honestly, these days, isn\'t it, it\'s a privilege to be able to give back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s something I never forget. And that\'s, that\'s something I always tell people as well, like, you know, you don\'t have to. You don\'t have to thank me. Like people are always like, oh, thank you for this like that. I don\'t, you know, you don\'t have to thank me. I, I acknowledge that, you know, it\'s just a privilege for me to be able to do this for you and that throws some people off, but Hey, it knows what it is, but we, I don\'t know how to bridge that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially as a, as a woman of color, who\'s been asked to do free things as a woman, as a woman of color, as a [00:42:00] person of color. I get it. I get it. I definitely</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> get. I, I, I was really glad when I, I think it was Josepha my first contact with hearing someone say that it\'s a privilege to contribute. Um, and I hadn\'t really thought about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that does that\'s good language, I think, because it, it gives honor to that role and that capacity, but it also understands that that might not be. An individual is at, at that time, then I think you have to extend yourself and go further and, and look at who is underprivileged or who lacks these privileges and how can we raise them up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we open doors? Um, and that that\'s, what\'s cool about the mentoring and, and the community stuff. Cause I think that\'s, that\'s what it does, you know, get it will help. It will help. There are other ways to, to give back and. [00:43:00] And it\'s, it can take years it\'s years of relationships and, and growth where, um, that that\'s what\'s needed to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can\'t, you can\'t what we\'re saying here. You can\'t just treat people like cogs. Like they\'re not all in the same category. They\'re not the same time of life and they\'re not the same people. And when you really know, get to know them, um, they\'ve unique gifts and capacities and what they\'re okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. With doing. um, at the moment and it\'s okay for everyone to say, and they, they, they need to, like, I need to, I need to step back. I need, um, I think we\'ve been, there\'s been so much more, um, recognition of that. Um, mm-hmm , uh, someone was tweeting the other day of like, they\'re just too much coming at. \'em too much stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re gonna, they\'re gonna give their, um, word camp ticket to someone else. And. Step back from going there. And, um, and a lot of people are [00:44:00] really supportive of that. Like, yeah, it\'s tough. Uh, tough call maybe, but, um, it\'s okay to it\'s okay to say, you know, I I\'ve hit my limit here. Um, mm-hmm .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> That. Yeah, I think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m gonna backtrack. I think that that\'s a great way. That would be a, a big help to helping people letting them know it\'s okay. That needs to be more clear if you can\'t do this right now. It\'s okay. Like you said, like, you know, Joseph said it\'s a privilege and you know, letting these people know, like, um, that doesn\'t mean you\'re not privileged if you can\'t do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, that\'s just not your time and that\'s, and that\'s completely okay. Right. And I, I like that. I like that a lot. And I, I really like that. I think also another big thing. We need to get people to see the value mm-hmm and giving back. Because again, like what\'s the value. If I can\'t make money, if I have to like take time out of my life where I\'m missing with my family or my friends, what\'s the, what value do I have to, some people like, just knowing it\'s going to [00:45:00] improve the life of someone else is not enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it\'s okay though. It\'s okay. Um, but how do we get people to see the value in this? I think community seeing people like me, who, you know, I could not, I could stop giving back tomorrow and be okay and go do other things with my life. But I don\'t wanna do that. I like giving back. It\'s valuable to. . I have a lot of things I value about giving back, especially in this community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I stand up there and I talk about it and I tell people and I give to them, honestly, I think that\'s the number one thing I\'ve seen in my life that makes other people wanna give. If they can see the value that other people are getting, that isn\'t tangible, nobody\'s handing me money to do any of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>so I think being a, a beacon of that helps, and I think I wish we had more people, but it\'s, it\'s hard if you\'re, if you\'re doing all of this and you\'re giving your time away, it\'s hard to be like, you know, the poster job for that as well. Um, right. We a lot of people have families. I don\'t know what I would do if I had children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I would probably just [00:46:00] scrap \'em to my chest. One of those little baby vests. I like those. Yeah. I used to do that in front of you. Yeah. Oh, I love those. I would just scrap \'em to my chest and like, I guess we</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> around and talk. I\'m glad to be through that kind of, um, yeah, my, my younger two daughters are, um, on finishing high school now, so it\'s pretty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s on their own, but, uh, yeah, that was, that was tough. That was interesting. I was the home parent. Um, and at one point, yeah, they were like, mm-hmm um, four girls they were mostly there with me and yeah, the two close together. Um, yeah. It\'s uh, well freelancing and doing neighborhood projects. It, it was, um, it was a lot and yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And mm-hmm it makes you, it makes you sensitive. the fact that you need to, you need to understand people in their context and so that, like you don\'t mm-hmm so you can kind of help on your end too. You don\'t ask too much or that, you know, you know, how to, [00:47:00] how to phrase, um, you know what they\'re, they\'re just some conditions like you understand like, oh, this is, isn\'t a good, this isn\'t a good time or a good person to, to ask to, to help with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or. Or maybe they need, you know, just knowing what the needs are and where you can be supportive to. Um, yeah, just the, the more you get deeper into individual relationships, I think the stronger and more, um, sensitive like community is the, like those go together, the strong and sensitive . Cause you\'re, you\'re aware of each other as individuals and, um, that holds things nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that made me, I was one. The last thing I, I was thinking while you were saying that there, there are so many, I think there are so many things people do or don\'t do that. Some things need to not be done. that, that contribute so [00:48:00] much. And we know it and, and sometimes it there\'s other forms of recognition that are important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like yeah. If the, if WordPress cord doesn\'t move forward, everything else fails. And there\'s like, there\'s a level. um, mm-hmm of focus and need on that, that that is is unique, but then there\'s stuff that\'s farfield from maybe any, any teams that is so important in the ecosystem. And, um, uh, a guy, everyone I think has nothing but prays for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin O Hashi who, um, who like Kevin O Hashi, who does the, um, uh, WordPress benchmarks? WooCommerce too. Have you ever looked at those? Uh, there\'s kind of neutral third party deep, um, uh, analysis each year of, um, performance on load testing and, and a bunch of other stuff of, of hosts. Who, who, um, partner with them who say like, yeah, here here\'s our, here\'s a free account [00:49:00] and all of our tiers test them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, never go through those and, and see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I have, um, I have, did I do last year? I have, I have, I I\'m like, I\'m just going back in my mind, but I have, and I think that is really, really, really awesome. That does that. I\'m so sorry. I hear</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> from people a lot about, about that. Like that\'s a, that\'s a major service because there there\'s a lot of data poverty in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your plugin isn\'t in the re.org repo, like what do we know? What, what, what do you, what do we know about that whole, um, part of the market? And if you are in it, it\'s very limited. What, what data you get out, um, hosting, you know, going way back has always been. A pretty murky place for are these real reviews?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, Jen . Oh man. So this is like the [00:50:00] one he\'s got the one, um, the one shining beacon of reliable, trustworthy stuff.

Um, I, I forget what is, what the, what the revenue model there is, but this is, this is one guy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, this isn\'t some growth oper organization. Um, it, those are really difficult things. The things we need to subsidize or help that, um, are. Kind of have a regulatory effect that help protect the space and the commons, um, because they don\'t aim at massive growth and they aim at a giving you a really honest signal on, um, you know, how are, how are these hosts doing one, one compared to another, what do you get for this, [00:51:00] this price point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And. They, um, it\'s good for them. They, they know where they stand and how they\'re, how they\'re doing. I\'m sure they have their own data, but it\'s a huge incentive to, um, to compete where we want them to . Um, there\'s a lot, there\'s a lot of different things like that. There\'s just certain personalities who give back a ton on, um, social media or in, um, their willingness to, to teach others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but. Yeah, I don\'t know. Do we recognize that openly enough? Um, and I think people doing stuff for the love of it is a huge privilege and it really, it is really is gratifying when people say thank you. So, um, we should do that more and thank you for starting meetups.

The consensus was “yes it is,” although we’ve certainly included many WordPress-adjacent or partnered companies on our (updated) <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/acquisitions/\">Acquisitions</a> page. The <a href=\"https://investors.digitalocean.com/news/news-details/2022/DigitalOcean-to-Acquire-Cloudways/default.aspx\">number-filled announcement to investors</a> and <a href=\"https://s27.q4cdn.com/619704647/files/doc_downloads/2022/DigitalOcean-Cloudways-Acquisition-Infographic.pdf\">infographic</a> from <strong>DigitalOcean</strong> make it clear they know they are buying (or rather getting deeper) into the WordPress ecosystem by acquiring <strong>Cloudways</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“The acquisition of Cloudways expands DigitalOcean’s serviceable market within global SMBs and increases options for <strong>digital agencies, eCommerce sites, bloggers, freelance developers and builders hosting on WordPress</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Magento</strong>. WordPress is the most popular content management system (CMS) and, according to <strong>W3Techs</strong>, it powers 43% of all websites on the internet.”</p><cite>&#8220;DigitalOcean to Acquire Cloudways&#8221; • bold text added for <strong>emphasis</strong></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>DigitalOcean is embracing its role as a WordPress host and pivoting to define its market as, well, <em>us</em>. The bold text above highlights a large part of our membership and the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Big emphasis on SMBs.</strong> DigitalOcean sees itself expanding to gain small-to-mid-sized businesses (SMBs) in its customer demographic, and acquiring Cloudways with its WordPress and other open source eCommerce customers achieves that.</li><li><strong>Cloudways fills a big gap.</strong> There’s no easy button within DigitalOcean itself for setting up a WordPress site or anything else, but their 1-click apps are the latest progression toward something like that. It’s just not likely to appeal to most people in the low-end market <a href=\"https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/wordpress?utm_campaign=amer_brand_kw_en_cpc&utm_adgroup=digitalocean_wordpress_bmm&_keyword=digitalocean%20wordpress&_device=c&_adposition=&utm_content=conversion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5yYBhAjEiwAKXk_eCTLbvWw706hdVQiD8CFN5sup_3G_RMowCw_QPCtG5icj3v7gGg7ORoC4ukQAvD_BwE\">in its current state</a>. DigitalOcean marketing is still locked onto startups and developers too. I imagine all this will change if Cloudways is brought in as a SMB customer-facing easy-button.</li><li><strong>New Competition.</strong> Focusing on less-technical end users and the people who build their sites will put DigitalOcean in direct competition with other WordPress-focused Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers or hosting panel middleware like <strong>ServerPilot</strong> — which only works with DigitalOcean — and <strong>SpinupWP</strong>. Even more so than Cloudways, SpinupWP is host-agnostic — any server with a public IP and (currently) <strong>Ubuntu</strong> 20.04 or 22.04 will work with SpinupWP.</li><li><strong>Will DigitalOcean drop Cloudways’ support for competitors?</strong> In addition to DigitalOcean, Cloudways can be used with <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>Vultr</strong>, and <strong>Linode</strong>. Many of us wonder if that flexibility might go away now. If it does, that’s a wasted opportunity. Post Status Member <strong>Kevin Ohashi</strong> optimistically (and I hope rightly) <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C1WDQ9W05/p1661371977299379?thread_ts=1661260653.084159&cid=C1WDQ9W05\">opined nothing will be changed</a>: “If the customer isn\'t going to choose you, might as well still make money off them.”</li><li><strong>The terms “Build” and “Builder” are a large part of DigitalOcean’s messaging</strong> about the acquisition. In fact, the company’s mission is defined this way, in the context of the acquisition news release: “DigitalOcean simplifies cloud computing so builders can spend more time creating software that changes the world.” This sounds a lot like WordPress’s mission updated for the era of (increasingly low/no-code) website builders (the software and the people). It’s also rather different from DigitalOcean’s main public-facing messaging which is still focused on startups and developers.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Some interesting numbers from DigitalOcean:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>DigitalOcean and Cloudways have been close partners since 2014.</li><li>Cloudways has approximately 50% of its customers on DigitalOcean servers.</li><li>This acquisition increases DigitalOcean’s high spend customers by 18%. They will come away from the deal with a total of 124,000+ (new plus existing) customers paying $50+ per month, which is 84% of DigitalOcean’s total revenue. ($6.2M/mo. * 12 = $74.4M/yr.)</li><li>Cloudways is projected to contribute between $13 and $15 million of revenue to DigitalOcean’s bottom line in the remaining months of FY2022 after the deal closes in September.</li><li>The acquisition of Cloudways will expand DigitalOcean’s global employee base by 30%. A good deal of those jobs are in Pakistan, and the sale represents the &#8220;Pakistan tech sector\'s largest exit to date,” according to <strong>Jawwad Farid</strong>.

I\'m also pleased I upgraded then, because after they reverted to the  original price structure I realized I\'m getting every feature of the old and new Business plan at about half the current price, although the storage is much lower. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve dug in a little more since then, and this is clearly the best WP.com so far. Apart from some P2 demo sites, I\'ve never had much going on there. I have a second work account for &#8220;self-hosted&#8221; sites that use Jetpack, and it\'s still annoying to switch between them and manage subscriptions to comments and posts. You can only be longed into one .com identity at a time, and there\'s no way to sharing access with team members or clients except as admins of individual sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most surprising thing to see develop over the last six months or so is access to premium plugins — including Elementor and the Classic Editor, which are among the 36 &#8220;top premium plugins&#8221; listed. If you dig into the functional categories of plugins you can install, there are thousands. (I\'d love to know how these are being selected, or if all plugins in the .org repo are automatically included.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven\'t explored how I\'d go about adding &#8220;third party code&#8221; or installing any of the 50,000+ plugins in the .org repo, but that\'s allowed on my &#8220;Pro&#8221; plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see it would be relatively easy to set up a Substack-like site at WP.com because I know the plugins you\'d need, but for the average user they\'d really have to dig into some docs and do the work of educating themselves. What\'s badly needed are something like &#8220;blueprints&#8221; for instantly installing typical configurations of plugins and themes for a common use-case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several years ago I mapped out how I would strip down WordPress and turn it into a Substack-like membership site that used wp_mail / php_mail properly to see if I could get good deliverability with 100+ subscribers. (This is not a huge feat but a good exercise to get habituated to proper webmail/email practices that are mostly ignored, abused, or outsources as a problem for Mailgun, Mandrill, etc.) I should still do it, if I ever get the time, but it\'s cool to see a fully Open Source and better-than-Substack site becoming possible (and maybe preferable) at WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>\"<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-com-has-changed-a-lot/\">WordPress.com has changed a lot</a>\" by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/author/dan-knauss/\">Dan Knauss</a> was first published at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com\">Post Status - The Community for WordPress Professionals</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 11:53:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"Do The Woo Community: Building with WooCommerce in Uganda with Arthur Kasirye\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72669\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://dothewoo.io/building-with-woocommerce-in-uganda/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:399:\"<p>Listen to Arthurs WooCommerce story through his involvement with WordPress and the community in Uganda, Africa.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;

She notes:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The open-source community is aware of its security problem. In fact, the community is already attempting to build out institutions and standards to secure open source. For example, the Open Source Security Foundation, or <a href=\"https://openssf.org/\">OpenSSF</a>, has already met with the White House twice and has 10 dedicated workstreams all focused on securing the open-source ecosystem. Companies like Microsoft and Google, large open-source contributors, have pledged <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/16/white-house-open-source-security/\">$30 million</a> to support OpenSSF’s efforts. The <a href=\"https://ostif.org/\">Open Source Technology Improvement Fund</a> (OSTIF) was founded recently to provide free security auditing services to open-source projects and continues to grow.<br /><br /><em>However, on its own, the open-source community does not have the leverage to demand the resources and minimum security practices required. To preserve its core ethos as a free service and commodity, the open-source community cannot impose conditional requirements on its projects. As a collaborative of many volunteer developers, it also struggles to impose requirements on its own contributors.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder if that is really true and open source self-regulation is truly impossible.

This includes smaller related items like the shim for non-supporting browsers and adding PDF  support, which are being handled in separate tickets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal to generate WebP images by default for new JPEG image uploads has been controversial from the beginning. While the Google-sponsored contributors driving the project have made some revisions after an initial round of significant critical feedback, other contributors have continued to voice concerns that they said were not being considered. Several contributors reported issues with the feature and suggested that it should start by being opt-in, an idea that was summarily dismissed before the main work was committed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, WordPress lead developer Andrew Ozz weighed in on the ticket with <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:112\">new objections</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/MatthiasReinholz\">@MatthiasReinholz</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/eatingrules\">@eatingrules</a>, and others I think this approach is perhaps lacking. Why would there be twice as many image files taking up a lot of extra space when half of them will never ever be used anywhere?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>IMHO a better approach would be to just make all image sub-sizes WEBP. If JPEGs are indeed needed, these can be generated on-the-fly as needed. There is no point of clogging the web servers storage with all these useless files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if the WEBP file sizes are actually larger than the JPEGs, that would probably mean that better tools are needed, and this patch is premature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Six weeks ago, in response to one complaint that the &#8220;resources for conversion would be tremendous,&#8221; Google-sponsored core committer Adam Silverstein confirmed that resources for generating the images on upload would &#8220;increase dramatically.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However resources to serve an image will be lowered,&#8221; Silverstein said. &#8220;Since image uploading is very rare compared to image serving, the extra effort to compress and store images should be worth it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another problem Ozz cited in his objection to this approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Actually that dramatic increase of resources usage when uploading an image is a very bad side effect here,&#8221; Ozz said. &#8220;It means a lot of uploads will fail, and leave the users stranded. It also will increase support requests for both WordPress and the hosting companies dramatically. Don&#8217;t think this is acceptable. Because of this, even if image multi-mime support is needed in WordPress, the current approach doesn&#8217;t seem like a good solution.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approximately 24 hours later, Google-sponsored contributor Felix Arntz <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:114\">commented</a> to advise that the WebP fallback mechanism to JPEG for older browsers was ready for commit and that he planned to commit it in a few days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Please do not commit any more code here unless it is to address the dramatic increase of resources needed to create image sub-sizes after upload,&#8221; Ozz said. &#8220;As I said above such increase is unacceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Is there any data about how much more resources (memory, processing time, etc.) are needed when uploading different image sizes? Any estimate about how many sites may be affected by that? Any suggestions on how to deal with it? Do you know what happens when post-processing of an uploaded image fails?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Frankly for now it seems that this patch will have to be reverted and refactored in order to address this.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam Silverstein responded to his concerns with clarification on why they chose the current approach, in anticipation of certain edge cases and eventually adding support for formats like AVIF once it is more widely supported:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I tend to agree with your assessment that all sub-sizes should be generated as WebP only, that was the shape of the original proposal. For the vast majority of use cases/users this will work the best. I would be open to considering this for the default (with some mitigations, see below).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason we decided to generate both formats was for backwards compatibility considerations for the few edge cases we identified where WebP images will might not work: namely emailed images (some older outlook/windows clients), Open Graph tags (some services don&#8217;t support WebP) and older Safari browsers. One possibility we considered would be to keep only the full sized JPEG so it is always available for those edge cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;multi-mime&#8221; support here is built to generating multiple formats so you sites can provide a primary and fallback format with something like the <code>picture</code> element. This is less important for WebP since it is so widely supported, but would be helpful for adopting newer formats like AVIF by plugins or core.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Silverstein also said the option of generating images on the fly was something they need to figure out but &#8220;felt out of scope for this effort.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to the complaint regarding the dramatic increase in resources for image uploads, Silverstein said they are relying on the &#8220;retry&#8221; mechanism to mitigate this problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This change also doubles the number of times WordPress will retry&#8217; the image regeneration, so while processing time will increase, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see a jump in failures necessarily,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know we had trouble adding new sizes in the past, however that was before we added the retry mechanism.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team behind the WebP by default project is more focused on serving smaller image sizes on the frontend and considers the additional resource usage on upload a necessary sacrifice for WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The additional resources at upload time needs to be weighed against the reduced resources of serving the smaller WebP image, especially since serving typically occurs several orders of magnitude more frequently than uploading,&#8221; Silverstein said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If uploading fails after all the retries, the user has the same experience as currently: they are left with a broken, unusable image. That can probably be fixed, although I don&#8217;t think this change will increases failure rates.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress lead developer Dion Hulse also <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:123\">commented</a> on the ticket to report issues with WebP conversions in the WordPress Photo Directory:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Just noting here, that these additional webp conversions appear to have been the leading cause of upload failures on the WordPress Photo Directory in recent weeks. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org//intertrac/ticket%3A6142\">#meta6142</a>&nbsp;and tickets closed as duplicate of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The errors were generally along the lines of&nbsp;<code>Allowed memory size of 256M bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 90M bytes</code>&nbsp;(obviously with byte values) while attempting to perform the initial full-size-original jpeg -&gt; webp conversion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It hasn&#8217;t affected&nbsp;<em>every upload</em>, only that of certain images. Potentially related to the&nbsp;<code>$quality</code>&nbsp;value being passed for webp requests (IIRC the default of 82 was optimized for jpeg?).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Hulse <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12023\">disabled the JPEG to WebP conversion</a> as a result of these errors, as the photo directory doesn&#8217;t currently use WebP but noted that it &#8220;might be a sign that it might be worth considering only generating webp&#8217;s for the resized images, rather than for the original file too.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silverstein said they are investigating the issues Hulse reported, as it may have exposed a bug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ozz circled back to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:126\">recommend</a> that making sub-sizes on demand would be a better approach that has faster processing of uploaded images and reduced space requirements, since the additional JPEG images would not be generated unless needed. He also noted that the &#8220;retry&#8221; for image post-processing &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work as well as expected.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The bad news is that if the post processing fails, chances are the originally uploaded file will remain,&#8221; Ozz said. &#8220;Then it will be used everywhere as most of the code in WP falls back to available sizes, and the only size will be the original.

How are you doing Andrew?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] Andrew Palmer: I&#8217;m very good. Nathan. Thanks very much for inviting me on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:04] Nathan Wrigley: We are in the bowels of the Super Bock Arena and let&#8217;s be honest, it was a challenge finding this room, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:10] Andrew Palmer: It was, and especially as I was running late and you&#8217;ve been very kind to still accommodate me, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:15] Nathan Wrigley: You are, most welcome. Andrew&#8217;s been in the WordPress community for years and years and years, but it&#8217;s not been always on the up and up has it? You&#8217;ve had your moments where you&#8217;ve stepped away for a little while and now you&#8217;ve reemerged. Is that true? Is that fair to say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:28] Andrew Palmer: Kind of, I mean, I sold Elegant Marketplace to the wonderful people that InMotion Hosting. So that enabled me to go off and play golf for a little while, and invest in other businesses and interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:39] Nathan Wrigley: Do you think this is for you, you know, a moment of excitement or are you still with tentative steps?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] Andrew Palmer: It could be construed as a resurgence. I mean, I&#8217;ve always connected with the WordPress community, cuz we&#8217;re such a friendly bunch. I had an opportunity to develop plugins and be a product maker, and I took over a lot of products from a very good friend of mine and hopefully we&#8217;ve enhanced them and made them better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:04] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;ve listed a, a few of the things that you&#8217;ve been involved in, but you&#8217;ve obviously been involved in lots of different businesses. Do you think with 50,000 plus plugins in the WordPress repository, countless commercial plugins, are we in a saturated marketplace? What I mean by that is if you are creating a new product, is it very difficult to be discovered? Is discoverability really difficult? Okay, let&#8217;s take two scenarios. The first one you&#8217;ve got a budget to advertise. And the second one is if you have to bootstrap it and do more or less all of it yourself. So two parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:36] Andrew Palmer: You know, if you&#8217;re gonna do jerk sauce it&#8217;s still hard. You know, you&#8217;ve got supermarkets, they do their own brand as well. As soon as a brand new hot sauce comes out, the supermarkets go, oh, we&#8217;ve got our own version of this, and they charge you a few hundred thousand pounds to be put on the supermarket shelves. So, there&#8217;s always a price to pay isn&#8217;t it, it&#8217;s a pay to play arena in every single business aspect. So the benefit that we have in WordPress is that we can throw something onto WordPress dot org, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, throw is maybe not the right word because it does go through a, a little bit of moderation, one would hope, but, um, you know, you can throw out a free version of what you&#8217;ve got and test the market. That&#8217;s really cool because, you throw out an MVP and people then like it and you then put some pro versions together or pro bits and pieces and say, okay, yeah, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m willing to pay 10 30, 50, a hundred bucks for that a month or a year or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the competitive landscape of every business in the world is competitive by nature, because there are so many products out there that are similar. There&#8217;s loads of light bulbs out there. It&#8217;s not just Phillips. Loads of CDs, you know, it&#8217;s just not Phillips. So you gotta make your own way, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:51] Nathan Wrigley: With the whole plugin thing and the whole of saturation thing, you&#8217;ve launched several products over the course of your career. Most recently, maybe there&#8217;s something after this, but I think the most recent one is Bertha.ai. That&#8217;s actually the URL as well as the name of the product I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:07] Andrew Palmer: It is Bertha.ai. It&#8217;s uh, my very good friend and, uh, co-founder Vito Peleg phoned me far too early in the morning, because he gets up at five o&#8217;clock and said, hey, I got an idea, man, let&#8217;s do it. We did and financial situations, I&#8217;m the, you know, I&#8217;m the guy that&#8217;s got the cash and we invested in it and Vito invested, blood, sweat and tears as we all did. And I&#8217;ve got a development team, you know, and they worked really, really hard and we launched it at the end of September, 2021. It&#8217;s going well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] Nathan Wrigley: Is that the primary reason that you are here at WordCamp EU? Actually just rewind that a little bit. When the tickets were announced, I think you were the first person that I know who committed to coming. You probably weren&#8217;t the first person that bought a ticket, but in my social network, you were the first person who said, oh, I&#8217;ve done it. I&#8217;ve bought a plane ticket. I&#8217;ve got the hotel and blah, blah, blah. You must be fairly committed to these kind of events. And if that&#8217;s the case, what&#8217;s the thing? What&#8217;s the angle. Is it the community? Is it a bit of community, a bit of networking, a bit of marketing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:06] Andrew Palmer: It&#8217;s a lot about the community because, uh, I&#8217;m looking for developers, you know, so I need to chat to people and meet with people. And we are very lucky yesterday and got treated to a gin fest, by Codeable. Marcel who actually works in, for Codeable rather, in Portugal, did an event for Codeable and invited us all along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s all about networking, and we met a few, I met a few coders and had a good old chat, and that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. It&#8217;s me networking. Supporting the community, as much as I possibly can, being a bootstrap business. It&#8217;s quite expensive developing a plugin and there&#8217;s lots of things you have to commit to like getting a new CMO, you know, in Stephanie Hudson. She&#8217;s got her own business to run and, and we&#8217;re all kind of bootstrap minded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we all have to do little things and Vito&#8217;s got Atarim to do so he&#8217;s gonna concentrate more on that now. So, you know, I needed a sidekick. Stephanie&#8217;s that sidekick, who&#8217;s got the strategy and the marketing nouse and she&#8217;s also based in the U.S. Which is good. And Bertha is now incorporated in the U.S. as well. So it&#8217;s all. Moving along swiftly, but I did actually release a GDPR plugin last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So GDPR friendly fonts, but it&#8217;s a commercial one. There&#8217;s a few free ones out there, but ours is good. So, launching things all the time and improving the plugins and making sure that we are in touch with what people in the community actually want, because we are here. Plugins, I think are more here to support the developer than the, than the end client. To give them an easier way to market if you like, or an easier or quicker, faster speedier way to get their product out, whether it&#8217;s, uh, an MVP for themselves or whether it&#8217;s a website for a direct client .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins and extensions and themes. And you know, what Gutenberg Hub doing with Gutenberg? What Extendify are doing with Gutenberg is quite amazing and all the form plugins out there, you know, we&#8217;ve got, I&#8217;ve got very good friend Mark Westguard who&#8217;s does WS Form. It happens to be my favorite form. We happen to get on, which is really cool. So it&#8217;s about meeting these people. Coming together in Europe, biggest WordCamp in the world. You know, pretty good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:15] Nathan Wrigley: Do you have a battle plan though? Do you have, before you set off. I was wondering, because you said earlier you wanted to meet developers and today was contributor day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:22] Andrew Palmer: I couldn&#8217;t get in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:23] Nathan Wrigley: Was it just because you were a bit late?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:25] Andrew Palmer: No, I was a contributor, I was just late. I just kind of thought, well, do you know what? And Stephanie runs the Focus WP Facebook group. So we had a little meet up and we&#8217;ve gone out on the town and just met with a few people from the Focus Facebook group as well. So there&#8217;s always networking opportunities. There&#8217;s nothing else to do a WordCamp than have a great look at Porto, which is probably one of the best venues you could choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food&#8217;s cheap, and good. The weather has turned out to be better than we thought it would be. There&#8217;s a little spits and spots of rain, but effectively Porto&#8217;s a great historical town as So, you know, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a bit of a vacation stroke job bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:04] Nathan Wrigley: You said that you were in search of developers and the bit was gonna develop there was, so there was 500 odd today and it felt busy. Tomorrow, maybe more like, touching 3000. So it&#8217;s gonna be really busy. And if you haven&#8217;t got a, I don&#8217;t know, an agenda and a meeting list, do you literally just try to work out who in the room is a developer by just going up and talking?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:26] Andrew Palmer: Well, I&#8217;m gonna be standing on a booth as well for an hour or so. And I&#8217;m also going to, I&#8217;ve got a few meetings scheduled, which is pretty cool. With developers as well as, you know, funders and people like that who are interested in either investing in Bertha or doing some partnerships with Bertha and stuff like that. Because once you&#8217;ve got a plugin that kind of answers all the questions with copywriting within WordPress, people want to talk to you, which is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a long day, Nathan, you know, it&#8217;s a very long day and it goes into the evening. I&#8217;m gonna have opportunities to meet and chat with people all the time. I&#8217;ve got tons of Twitter messages to answer, and stuff like that. You know what it&#8217;s like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:02] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m struggling keep up with the different platforms. This person is over here on Slack, this person is over here on Twitter. Yeah it can be difficult. So let&#8217;s talk about your, well, I&#8217;m guessing the booth tomorrow is Bertha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:13] Andrew Palmer: No, the booth I&#8217;m gonna be helping out Atarim, because Vito&#8217;s a very good friend of mine and I know Atarim pretty well. I&#8217;ve used it from the very, very beginning, and now it&#8217;s on version three. It&#8217;s their third birthday. And Vito likes to run around. You can&#8217;t really keep him to a spot. There&#8217;s a bit of super glue we&#8217;ve snuck in there. But Alex Panagis, he&#8217;s gonna be on the booth as well, and I&#8217;ll be hanging around and just answering some questions that people don&#8217;t really get it or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, it&#8217;s so dual role. But of course Bertha&#8217;s gonna be mentioned in the conversations. Well, because that was actually the idea, is that Vito wanted an AI to be able to write within the note making facility, you know, you put these little notes on websites. So our first job was to make Bertha work in the front end of Atarim. And it does. So you can now, so customers can now say, right, I want this headline and then ask Bertha to generate an option for headlines and they&#8217;ll put it in. I want this paragraph here and all that kind of stuff, and Bertha can do that within Atarim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:10] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. I feel at this point, we should explain because we&#8217;ve stepped ahead. So okay, Bertha is a plugin for WordPress, which enables you to create AI content. So that could be any form of content. It&#8217;s just text, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:23] Andrew Palmer: Yeah, I think the best way to describe Bertha is that she is an AI copywriting assistant. So you are the editor, she&#8217;s the journalist that&#8217;s gone out and found the stories and the facts and the general content, and you working as the editor within WordPress, then edit that content and make it your own. And that&#8217;s the best way to describe Bertha. She&#8217;s not just a machine that says, right, write me a blog about this. We&#8217;ve got three things coming next week for the pro version. And one of them is very, very long form where you just give her a hint and she will write it for you. And then you just edit that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:58] Nathan Wrigley: All right, let&#8217;s build up the jigsaw of how it all works. So we install the plugin, all of that normal stuff. How do we seed Bertha with the idea? So for example, let&#8217;s say that we want to write a blog post about WordCamp Europe. How do we seed the idea into Bertha, and how much do we need to seed in, in order to get something decent back? Let&#8217;s go with a title first, just the title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:19] Andrew Palmer: Okay. Title you just say, what do I want to write about? So you just write, what do I wanna write about, I wanna write about blog posts being written by AI. And then say generate a headline around that. And Bertha will give you four alternatives, or two alternatives or three, depending on how good your one was, and you click and that&#8217;s, that then goes into the text bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you say, right, okay, I&#8217;m writing a blog post about this. So I&#8217;m gonna go to the blog post topic ideas model, and I&#8217;m going to give it the title and then, or going to give Bertha the title and then you press generate text and Bertha will come up with one to four or one to five blog post topic ideas. And then you put number one in as the title in a paragraph generator, and that will generate your paragraphs around that first topic idea. And then you just go through. It&#8217;s of a workflow that you get into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:07] Nathan Wrigley: People listening to this, they&#8217;re gonna think, okay, this is voodoo. How does this work? How does it work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:13] Andrew Palmer: Well we&#8217;re very open about how it&#8217;s done. It&#8217;s it is open AI dot com, and we&#8217;ve written our own models. And we now use the latest version of GPT-3, which is really fast and uses things called suffixes and prefixes. And it writes much, much better quality AI generated content. And it has the previous GPT, DaVinci was up to, I think, uh, 1999 or whatever it was. It was ages ago. It scraped 10% of the web to get the ideas for the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one is now 2021. June 2021. So much more recent content. If you wanna write about crypto, if you wanna write about FinTech or modern FinTech or anything that&#8217;s going on in the modern world. COVID for instance, you wanna write about that or the history of COVID from 1990, whenever it was. I can&#8217;t remember the dates COVID&#8217;s done my head in. It will write that history for you now. So it&#8217;s much better, much quicker, faster, better quality and, easier use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:16] Nathan Wrigley: People who&#8217;ve never used these tools before, they might have sort of concerns about a, does it scan, does it even read like a human wrote it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:24] Andrew Palmer: Oh, for sure it does, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:25] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So you can be pretty confident that it&#8217;s gonna scan well. But in terms of the quality, where do you stand on how much supervision. Is it like an aberrant child? Do you need to go back to it and give it some love and attention? Or is this a case of, I am just gonna press the button, not read, publish. There&#8217;s probably a bit of a spectrum, but how much of you come to trust it to be left to its own devices? Or how much do you go back through and read everything that it generated?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:52] Andrew Palmer: Well, when you are writing, you&#8217;re thinking about what you&#8217;re writing and Bertha does exactly the same thing. Doesn&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s gonna write a paragraph ahead. Just like I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m gonna say 10 seconds ahead. But I&#8217;m forming the words in my head and then they come outta my mouth and whatever. And I will make a few missteps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know politicians make missteps all the time, cause they, maybe they don&#8217;t engage brain before whatever, but, you have to be the editor. What I don&#8217;t want Bertha to be is a total AI copywriting situation. Just write everything for you, because that&#8217;s not fair on you as a producer of content, it&#8217;s not fair on your readers and it will eventually work against you because your content will become repetitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will become not unique. You won&#8217;t have your tone of voice necessarily. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s up to you, which AI generator you want to use. If you&#8217;re gonna be a spammer, then use the others. If you&#8217;re gonna, gonna really invest in your copy, but with the help of an AI, Bertha&#8217;s the way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:57] Nathan Wrigley: So would it be fair to categorize if you&#8217;re gonna do longish form, it&#8217;s a launchpad. You click the button and there&#8217;s an idea here&#8217;s where you could go. Not necessarily, there&#8217;s the finished product. It&#8217;s a bit like a junior journalist would hand to an editor and say, I think that this is the finished product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:15] Andrew Palmer: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:15] Nathan Wrigley: Is that where we&#8217;re at? You should generate this content, then look at it yourself on every occasion because the AI, right where we are now is not quite to be trusted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:25] Andrew Palmer: Well, yeah, just exactly like Tesla. They do an auto drive. It&#8217;s definitely not to be trusted. I was in one a few weeks ago on my travels in the States and all of a sudden we turned left into a bunch of roadworks, well what&#8217;s that about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, the driver was supervising quite well, but you know, you can&#8217;t trust AI completely. And I don&#8217;t think you ever should. There should always be some human interaction. That&#8217;s what I believe in that. My aim is with website production is to make it quicker, better, faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:55] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. Yeah. And it helps with those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:57] Andrew Palmer: Yeah. I mean you&#8217;re gonna save between 80 and 90% of your time that you would normally write a thousand word blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:03] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah I guess one of the concerns from people who maybe want to rail against this a little bit would be that that kind of control, that self control to go and read it, may not be forthcoming. In other words, we may have an internet where there&#8217;s tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, possibly of blogs out there that are just pumping out content, click the button, publish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:27] Andrew Palmer: Yeah but we&#8217;ve, let&#8217;s not be naive about this. We&#8217;ve always had that. There&#8217;s always been spinners of text and you know, the affiliate marketing world and the health and fitness world for years, you know, even before WordPress dare I say, you know, there was always people spinning content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why things like Copyscape exist. Try and make sure that nobody&#8217;s using your content. But Bertha&#8217;s not just for blog post writing. Bertha actually helps you with every single aspect of your website. And the whole reason that we&#8217;ve got it in WordPress is because you can go through each model or each template. And you can write your homepage. You can write your services page, you can write your about us page. You can enhance your product descriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s so many models now in templates in there now, and next week we&#8217;ll be launching social media templates as well. So you can write a Facebook ad or Twitter post or whatever, within Bertha. So, you know, there&#8217;s plenty to look at, and the fact it&#8217;s free is where I&#8217;m at. I think we&#8217;re helping the community get a grip with free AI. You get a thousand words a month for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:35] Nathan Wrigley: How does the UI actually work? So presumably we&#8217;re in Gutenberg or the old classic editor. How do we interact with it? So we click into the title, take us from there. Is it like Grammarly? Does something sort of hover over us, which says engage Bertha?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:48] Andrew Palmer: Pretty much. And it&#8217;s any page builder. It doesn&#8217;t need to be just classic editor or, it is literally any page builder. And the guys at visual builder, or Visual Composer rather. They helped us immensely with Visual Composer because they&#8217;ve rebuilt that from the ground up and helped us code Bertha so that she works perfectly with Visual Composer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a Divi guy. I needed it to work within Divi. That was quite challenging. We&#8217;ve managed to do that. And Elementor as well. So whatever you are in, whether you are in a text field in Gutenberg or a text field within any page builder that you choose to use, Bertha&#8217;s little icon is there, just winking at you saying, I&#8217;m here to help. You click on that and then a sidebar comes out and then you&#8217;ve got all the models and you&#8217;ve got the web or the blog, website, content, blog, AIDA, PAS, P A S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, we&#8217;ve even got evil Bertha, she&#8217;s quite fun. Bit of a sarcastic bot there. That was one of my favorites that we put in there. Uh, and then you have, on a separate dashboard, you have long form as well. So that&#8217;s a separate thing where you can just write long form content. Format it for your blog, and that will save, save it within your own database. And the benefit of Bertha is one, it&#8217;s unlimited users, because anybody that can sign into your website can use Bertha. Two it&#8217;s really accessible for WordPress users. If you&#8217;re used to WordPress, you can use Bertha and you can start using Bertha effectively within 10 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nice thing is, is that every single template has either a 30 second or one minute instructional video embedded in the sidebar. So you just play the video. You go, okay, that&#8217;s how I do that. The long form one, because it&#8217;s long form and it&#8217;s slightly more complex, you need to use a bit more logic with it, the instructional video is 10 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:30] Nathan Wrigley: The different language models that you&#8217;ve got, you mentioned the evil one and, you know, we could have the pirate one for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:36] Andrew Palmer: There is, we can do that tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:37] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. But there could be the sales for example, or I don&#8217;t know, whatever it may be. They genuinely spit out different content? And is that composed with a different choice of verbs or a different choice of vocabulary. And if you go for the humorous one it&#8217;s gonna throw out some curve balls and some interesting fruity language?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:54] Andrew Palmer: Frank Sinatra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:55] Nathan Wrigley: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:55] Andrew Palmer: Hey blue eyes, how you doing? We wanted it to be fun, right? So you&#8217;ve got the tone of voice. So you have your title. Who&#8217;s it aimed at? Is it business users, people that buy flowers, people that buy motorbikes, people that love WP Tavern? What&#8217;s the tone? Is it fun? Is it innovative? Is it classy? Is it hilarious? Is it Frank Sinatra? You know, you can put in those. Is it Rocky Balboa? You know, whatever you wanna put in there as the tone of voice. And, uh, Bertha will speak in that tone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:25] Nathan Wrigley: Presumably GPT-3 means that there was a two and there will be a 4. Do you have any insight into that? Is that the kind of thing which rolls out on an annual basis?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:34] Andrew Palmer: GPT-3 has actually been improved. You&#8217;re on now DaVinci two. We use the highest engine, which is DaVinci ,and we use DaVinci two and there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s another thing called babble and other things within it. You can kind of downgrade it. So for evil Bertha we use, um, I think it&#8217;s babble because it kind of just, it&#8217;s more sarcastic. It kind of gives better results. So we test all the models within the playground of Open AI and then we go, okay, well that&#8217;s how we can write that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we write the, we write the prompts and that&#8217;s the benefit of us being web developers. You know, Vito&#8217;s done thousand websites, I&#8217;ve done hundreds and maybe a couple of thousand three, three or 4,000 actually, if I look back on it, cuz I&#8217;m old these days and I&#8217;ve been building websites pre WebPress, right. Macromedia jobs and, even Front Page, but there you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know what people want in a website. The content, the kind of flow, the blurbs, even the content. We&#8217;ve actually got a model for the contact form blurb. How to ask people to contact you. Because we know websites. We&#8217;ve built it specifically for website owners and website developers and producers, because getting content out of a client, that&#8217;s why Atarim exists. Getting content out of a client is like getting blood out of a stone. if you give them a method to do it or a way to do it, you&#8217;ll get it much quicker. You&#8217;ll complete your projects quicker. You will then be able to take on more projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:59] Nathan Wrigley: So that&#8217;s an interesting piece, isn&#8217;t it? The idea that you can, well previously you&#8217;d fill it up with lorem. If the client didn&#8217;t deliver the text, in goes lorem just to fill the space. To give it some indication of how it might look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:10] Andrew Palmer: That&#8217;s why Bertha is called the Lorem Ipsum killer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:13] Nathan Wrigley: There you go, so that&#8217;s a really bonafide use of it, isn&#8217;t You basically push the button, fill it up with actual content. And even if the client doesn&#8217;t want to use it, then of course, I guess they could go in and edit it, or just start again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:25] Andrew Palmer: Exactly. Yeah. You can actually deliver a completed website to a client with text. In the right format, in the right places, everything. And it won&#8217;t add a great deal of time to your development process. It will save a massive amount of time on deliverables. The client will see it. They&#8217;ll get it. And they&#8217;ll go, well, actually, I don&#8217;t wanna use that word or I don&#8217;t, I think that&#8217;s outta context, let&#8217;s rewrite it to that, and you can even use Bertha to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:50] Nathan Wrigley: So can you, as a website builder who maybe only wants certain permissions to go out to your clients, you can enable them to use Bertha or not use Bertha? There&#8217;s different permissions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:00] Andrew Palmer: Yeah there is within the settings page. We&#8217;ve done a, a nice little dashboard, nice little onboarding as well, you know, makes it easier for people to understand what it is. And there&#8217;s an intro video on the onboarding as well, which will probably update because couple of things have slightly changed, but because we&#8217;ve embedded the instruction videos within Bertha, it makes it much easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re launching a deep dive academy in a few weeks time, and it is a few weeks time, because we&#8217;re just building out the long form videos. So educational videos of how to write a blog post, how to build a website from scratch using Bertha. How to use particular page builders and stuff. And that&#8217;s being done by Imran Sadiq who has been a godsend on the training. I mean he produced 54 training videos in just under 21 days. So he was a find, I&#8217;ve gotta tell you. He&#8217;s my, he&#8217;s my favorite person currently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:50] Nathan Wrigley: When you push the button, and it spits out content. Presumably there&#8217;s a cost to that. In other words, it goes to a computer somewhere else. Maybe that&#8217;s your computer. Maybe it&#8217;s somebody else&#8217;s infrastructure. I don&#8217;t know, but there&#8217;s a cost for that transaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m guessing that there&#8217;s gonna be constraints on the free version. Maybe that&#8217;s the number of times you can click the button, the amount of text you can produce, because I know that there&#8217;s a premium version as well. Just talk us around the pricing and the constraints that you&#8217;ve got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:15] Andrew Palmer: Well, I made a decision because I, you know, I&#8217;ve invested in Bertha both time and money. I want people to use her. So a thousand words a month will cost me money, but that&#8217;s part of the investment, right? So currently, and I have no real reason to change this, everybody can use Bertha for free with every single model in it, except the new ones that I&#8217;ve said, because they are expensive to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So somebody&#8217;s gonna have to pay for those, and also pro users only get to use the academy as well. It&#8217;s free to pro users. So there are some constraints on the free use. But I, I love the fact that people are signing up. We&#8217;re getting probably 15 to 20 users signing up free per day, and they&#8217;re using it. Because we have a monitor. We, we don&#8217;t monitor what they use. We keep a record of what&#8217;s generated, but not by whom. You know, we don&#8217;t know which websites have generated, but that also helps us improve the model as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also if it gives empty responses, which sometimes it does. But we can see we&#8217;ve got a little, when a new user starts, we can see that there&#8217;s zero. And then within 10 minutes of them starting, they&#8217;ve used 250 words. We&#8217;re thinking, yay. You know, they&#8217;re getting it. They&#8217;re really looking at it. And then they go to 1,012 words because we&#8217;ve done it just over the thousand, because there&#8217;s nothing more frustrating when you click that button, you run out of words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, we let them, if it&#8217;s got to 998 and then they want to generate more, we let them generate the next sentence and they go, sorry, you gotta wait another month or upgrade. You know, of course I&#8217;m a very commercial person and people who know me know that I&#8217;m commercial, but you know, wait another month. But with a thousand words, you could write a homepage. You could write good about us page, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:57] Nathan Wrigley: The thought occurs to me that AI is getting its claw into almost everything. You&#8217;ve got Alexa in the living room and you&#8217;ve got the possibility to create pieces of artwork with all sorts of AI content. And I&#8217;m just wondering given your position, you&#8217;re obviously thinking a lot about AI. What do you make of the future of website building? So not the, not the content. Not that piece. The bit about the layout, the feel, the color palette, use of fonts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I just find it almost inevitable that at some point we&#8217;re gonna be talking to the website building process, and we&#8217;re gonna be saying, I want a homepage with a picture of a stadium in the background with these words, and then you&#8217;ll see what it puts out and actually no change the font. Make it H2 instead of an H1 and so on. Do you think that&#8217;s closer than I&#8217;m imagining? Cause I&#8217;m still thinking that&#8217;s decades off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:49] Andrew Palmer: Oh, it&#8217;s definitely not decades off. It&#8217;s 24 months off. You know, if you really, really get into it because, um, Google are working on image generation. But let&#8217;s also not forget that AI can examine an image and see what&#8217;s in it. So, the stock Adobes, the Shutterstocks of this world will think, well, hang on a second, we can tie up with an AI and ask it to recognize this gray head fella in a rowing boat, doing some fishing, whatever, no offense Nathan, and then produce that image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it would be, it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have to be an AI generated image because there are millions of, of images out there. And imagine if you&#8217;ve got the WordPress repository with that&#8217;s now, and I&#8217;ve forgotten the name of where the images are on WordPress, but…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:34] Nathan Wrigley: Openverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:36] Andrew Palmer: So Openverse is an AI feeder of images. You know, I want a nice lakeside image with no people in it, because that&#8217;s part of the Openverse terms and conditions. There&#8217;s no people in it, but I want a nice lakeside view, in landscape and I want the sun to be shining. And the AI will go out and search that, find that, and place it within your Gutenberg block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:55] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s interesting because I wonder, I wonder if people, so the particular next thing I&#8217;m gonna say relates to Bertha.ai. So I wonder if it&#8217;s got content creators, people whose job is to create copy. She&#8217;s got them shaking in their boots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, I wonder if this event that we&#8217;re at WordCamp Europe, 2022. I wonder if in two or three years time given everything that you&#8217;ve just said, maybe coming down the pipe, if it will be a totally different experience. The whole build process will be different and we&#8217;ll be concerning ourselves with all sorts of other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the block editor might be a very, very different thing. And page builders look different. With the rate of change, and the fact that AI can sort of seed itself and make itself cleverer, much, much more quickly than we can, I do wonder what it&#8217;s gonna be like in a few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:40] Andrew Palmer: There are some very clever people out there as well. You know, let&#8217;s not name drop too many people. Elementor for instance, who&#8217;ve got their cloud version now. In there, there&#8217;s a, a workflow and say, what type of websites you want? What do you want it to look like? What&#8217;s the colorways and boom, there it is. Extendify doing the same. You&#8217;ve got all the content blocks. What do you want in there? And you take you through a workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress will do that with their new $5 a month package, you know, and hosting and they&#8217;ll, they will build your website on the fly and, and, BoldGrid, I think it&#8217;s BoldGrid by, InMotion. It&#8217;s like a page builder that people don&#8217;t actually know about, but when I got into conversations with InMotion about them buying Elegant Marketplace, and I was basically a Divi marketplace, I&#8217;m saying, why don&#8217;t we make stuff BoldGrid, because you can go in there and say, I want a florist website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Press a button, you&#8217;ve got 10 pages of flourish websites with all the images and the text. All you do is go in and edit the text. So that&#8217;s not AI, that&#8217;s just intelligent people saying, this is how we want people to build websites. So, with the advantages of AI and people like Matthew Renze, who I met in Las Vegas a few weeks ago. He&#8217;s at the top level of AI, and some conversations that I have with him, what&#8217;s coming, man is gonna blow your head off. It&#8217;s crazy what&#8217;s coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:57] Nathan Wrigley: On that bombshell. Andrew Palmer. Thanks for joining us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:00] Andrew Palmer: You&#8217;re more than welcome Nathan.

Theme authors have frequently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ask-the-bartender-is-there-a-starter-for-building-block-themes\">asked if there is a good starter theme for building block themes</a>, but at the moment there are really only a handful, as the block themes era is just dawning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WebREDONE, a Serbia-based web agency, has open sourced its new starter theme, <a href=\"https://webredone.com/blog/wordpress-theme-starter-theme-redone/\">Theme Redone</a>, that offers a foundation for building websites and Gutenberg blocks with an MVC framework:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>We’ve taken the inspiration from Laravel and other similar projects that really approached this aspect of coding cleverly and made it a breeze to organize and reason about the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Laravel, we would write plain old PHP for the logic, and then we would use Blade templates for the View layer, we also have model, view, and controller files to separate the concerns and organize code logically and efficiently. We have adopted that same approach but in the context of the WordPress environment. Conceptually, the way we organize code is similar to Laravel, but with a few differences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme Redone brings this approach to Gutenberg block files, identifying a &nbsp;<a href=\"https://webredone.com/theme-redone/gutenberg-blocks-framework/block-structure/model-json/\">model.json</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://webredone.com/theme-redone/gutenberg-blocks-framework/block-structure/controller-php/\">controller.php</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://webredone.com/theme-redone/gutenberg-blocks-framework/block-structure/view-latte/\">view.latte</a> file.

Select extensions can be loaded up on a private test site for 30 days before the site self-destructs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although WooCommerce.com already offers a 30 day money back guarantee if users are unhappy with a purchase, the sandbox testing offers a frontline prevention for customers having to invoke the money back guarantee. It saves both parties time and resources by allowing customers to test extensions against their unique inventory of needs without committing to buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flow for this feature is strategic in that it requires prospective customers to log in or create an account in order to test an extension. This enables users to come back and revisit their test sites later during the decision-making process. WooCommerce.com can also collect data on how many sandboxes are started for each of its extensions and determine which ones are struggling to convert. I would not be surprised if WooCommerce ends up streamlining these sandboxes for better conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In my test of this feature I chose the WooCommerce Pre-Orders extension. Once logged in, the site loaded up in seconds with the extension already activated on an empty store. I was successfully able to create a product as being available for pre-order.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The live testing feature is not yet available for all extensions. WooCommerce engineer Rémi Corson reports that it&#8217;s currently active on the following products (with more on come in the future): follow-up emails, product add-ons, product CSV import suite, product vendors, table rate shipping, bookings, checkout field editor, points and rewards, and  pre-orders. Any of the available extensions can be simultaneously activated on an existing test site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce.com&#8217;s sandbox sites are set up strictly for testing extensions in a simple way. This may not be the best if you need to rule out conflicts with other extensions during your tests. The test sites do not allow you to install a different theme or add any other plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, the live testing feature should be adequate to answer most questions users have prior to purchasing an extension. It&#8217;s also great for demonstrating to a client in case of the necessity to justify the expense. Some of these extensions are in the range of $100-$249/year billed annually, which is not a trivial expense for people who are just getting started with a store and wondering if the extension will suit their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce.com is one of many digital product creators in the WordPress space that already employs this type of testing, though the life of the sandbox varies from an hour to several weeks. Offering instant live testing is definitely the way to go if you don&#8217;t want to offer a free version of your extension where users would pay to upgrade. It saves users the hassle of having to set up their own test sites and get a refund, but also allows them to truly browse a host of commercial add-ons that they may not have otherwise thought to explore.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 01:37:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: WordPress 6.1 to Add a Block Themes Filter to Menu on the Theme Install Screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137238\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-1-to-add-a-block-themes-filter-to-menu-on-the-theme-install-screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1575:\"<p>In July, WordPress&#8217; Themes and Meta teams collaborated to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-directory-adds-block-themes-to-filter-menu\">add a new “Block Themes” menu item</a> to the filter menu on the directory homepage in an effort to improve block themes&#8217; visibility. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">Block themes</a> currently account for less than 2% of the directory&#8217;s 9,900 themes but activating one is the only way users can take advantage of WordPress&#8217; full-site editing capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all users hunt for their next theme directly on WordPress.org.

The Gutenberg plugin is in active development and new features are created all the time. These new features come also with new APIs that are declared &#8216;experimental&#8217; until the team is sure that it&#8217;s a prudent implementation for this part of block editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a major WordPress release is worked on, Gutenberg plugin code is merged with WordPress Core, and when these experimental APIs make it into the stable version of WordPress, they also earn consideration for backwards compatibility and de-facto code that needs to be maintained for a  few versions before they can be deprecated again.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam Zielinski suggests that before a feature makes it into Core that experiemental APis are audited and either are not merged into WordPress or worked on to migrate them as stable APIs. If a feature depending on  an experiemental API is not yet stable enough, and other features also depend on the API, both should not be deemed mergable to the next major WordPress version. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other developers caution, that it might slow down the pace when new block editor features come to WordPress. For the impatient that might be of concern, I also have the feeling that it&#8217;s not a bad thing, when Gutenberg latests features stay in the oven to bake a little longer before they are merged and used by millions of people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sarah Gooding </strong>also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-proposal-calls-for-contributors-to-stop-merging-experimental-apis-from-gutenberg-to-wordpress-core\"><strong>New Proposal Calls for Contributors to Stop Merging Experimental APIs from Gutenberg to WordPress Core</strong></a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>🎙️ </strong> New episode: <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-71-fluid-typography-block-api/\">Gutenberg Changelog #71 – Gutenberg 13.8, Fluid Typography, updates to the  Block API and more</a> &#8211; with co-hosts Grzegorz Ziolkowski and Birgit Pauli-Haack </p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-g\">Gutenberg Plugin Releases</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> wrote about Gutenberg 13.8 on the WP Tavern. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-13-8-introduces-fluid-typography-support-and-revamped-quote-block\"><strong>Gutenberg 13.8 Introduces Fluid Typography Support and Revamped Quote Block</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Gutenberg 13.8, the first implementation of fluid typography is available. <strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> posted a Call for <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/08/15/testing-and-feedback-for-the-fluid-typography-feature/\">Testing and Feedback for the Fluid Typography Feature</a> </strong>asking theme developer to stress test the feature with classic, hybrid and block themes and various other scenarios. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime Gutenberg 13.9 was released. <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/oandregal\">André Maneiro</a></strong> was the release lead and published the posted <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-9-17-august/\"><strong>What’s new in Gutenberg 13.9?

Clarifying language and coming to some consensus about the terms and definitions that help people understand the project is really important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-718bb272-a14c-4904-ab72-ded6fd3e100e\">However, a lot of valid points about those terms and the details of the 5ftF program got deep into the weeds or focused on things that simply are what they are and aren\'t going to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(That\'s the stuff that gets labelled &#8220;drama&#8221; and falls on deaf ears or gets batted around unhelpfully by people who should have better things to do.  Everyone has heard it a million times. Don\'t worry, I\'m not going to touch any of it.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-5c310172-f0f5-4a15-89fb-9d9383586416\">We can only move forward, but are we living in the past?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-6c135ce9-57d9-48af-8a0d-e0bd756ba174\">As an open source project, the only question that really matters is, &#8220;What will drive WordPress forward?&#8221; Not in an ideal or theoretical world but with the army we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-563ef72a-ad24-4271-bdaa-2d540b279c33\">Or, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/08/01/open-source-and-the-free-rider-problem/\">as Josepha Haden-Chomphosy put it</a>: &#8220;How can we rebalance the tenacious need for contribution with the immense benefit WordPress brings to everyone&#8221; in the WordPress ecosystem?</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-cb7c0968-427e-4652-8704-a63477ffcd44\">That question got lost in the reactions, but it\'s the one that matters most.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Notice how these words are delicately balanced and easily tipped over. You can read &#8220;tenacious need for contribution&#8221; as a threatening demand — a clawback on a &#8220;benefit&#8221; you might not consider &#8220;immense&#8221; or as immense as someone else\'s.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-907aaa2f-8d3f-45af-9c7a-9bfe571224f6\">Notice how these words are delicately balanced and easily tipped over. You can read that &#8220;tenacious need for contribution&#8221; as a threatening demand — a clawback on a &#8220;benefit&#8221; you might not consider &#8220;immense&#8221; or as immense as someone else\'s. You can read it as a description of scarcity all on one side and abundance all on the other. You could tear it up and set it on fire. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And some people do do that. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The world as it is</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-42326f40-b8b4-4d74-af21-e69be310347a\">Especially in the world of WordPress extenders, builders, and generally small business operators doing well enough to start a podcast or opinion blog, this seems to be where we get stuck. (That\'s the big, long tail of the open source communities I\'ve been in for two decades.) I\'ve watched this all happen before around an open source CMS that once dominated the market. Imbalances, inequities, and unfairness got emphasized, and the community didn\'t get past its deadlock of grievances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-42326f40-b8b4-4d74-af21-e69be310347a\">I\'m not going to say there aren\'t imbalances and all the playing fields are perfectly level because that\'s not true. (It never is, anywhere.) But I will say it doesn\'t do any good to keep saying this. Repetition of failed patterns is not just a definition of derangement, it is a failure to grow into mature thinking. To really face the world as it is requires a capacity for living with apparently unsolvable contradictions. It is less about &#8220;being smart&#8221; and more about a tolerance for the mental stress and pain of not having control or all the answers. It\'s fucking hard, but not being able to do it does harm to individuals and the groups they\'re in. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>We can cope better with hard problems and survive to solve them another day if we first get ourselves united around common interests, motivations, and values. And that is the task our oldest, most adapatable, legacy systems — human languages — were invented to do as we muddle along together on this planet.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-505bdd5e-f2fe-4c3c-9673-566df571dcf1\">I\'m also not going to say we can make deep problems disappear by not talking about them or by using evasive language. I do think we can cope better with hard problems and survive to solve them another day if we first get ourselves united around common interests, motivations, and values. And that is the task that human languages were invented for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-24ad1539-b961-418f-b0f9-9d1098a1392a\">There\'s nothing like an external threat to unite people, usually. Lately there\'s been a lot of concern about the end to growth and possible losses in WordPress\' market share. I\'d worry more about losing relevance with younger generations of people with different outlooks, interests, and needs. That\'s people doing stuff. It\'s real. Market share will always be a statistic that dimly reflects what people are doing long after they started doing it. Today\'s failure to connect and communicate won\'t register on <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/cms\">the BuiltWith pie chart</a> for years when it\'s too late to get in front of.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Creators in community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-7dad336b-aaf2-4a48-a2c5-be3f8cb710ce\">So let\'s talk about the &#8220;Creator Economy.&#8221; It\'s not a trend but a pretty established thing now. Creators with a course, service, or product to sell generally don\'t want to focus too much on tools and even less on code — unless code is their service or product.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>That\'s where WordPress should be, and in a sense it is, but it uses the language of a 20 year-old open source project that is illegible to people in their 20s today.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-7d4fd33c-af8a-440d-807f-2e3f36ae4772\">WordPress and ever-increasing, low-cost, easy-to-use SaaS platforms have enabled Creators to focus on their business. Unlike those of us who were doing this back in the Stone Age, Creators don\'t have to install WordPress, try to bolt on installs of phpBB, GNU Mailman, and learn PHP4 to cope with a once-popular horror like osCommerce. Creators are in, or adjacent to the WordPress community, but they\'re unlikely to participate in it and contribute in the old, traditional ways that start with bugs and hacking. Software that\'s free as in beer and speech isn\'t attractive or even meaningful unless it\'s presented as a useful platform for their particular niche. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-7d4fd33c-af8a-440d-807f-2e3f36ae4772\">This is painful to hear, especially if this is how you entered the open source and WordPress community. Many of us became developers, designers, freelancers, communication and marketing consultants, and even product or agency founders this way. That was a different time in a different country — once the main doorway into WordPress, it\'s now a small, creaky backdoor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-f154735a-096a-4c53-a676-455606234ca8\">If you think this means Creators are narcissists and mercenaries who don\'t participate in communities or care about their tools, you are wrong. Helping them organize into communities that give them value is a smart move. WordPress products, especially ecosystem plugins, virtually grow their own communities. With a now-private Facebook page that\'s grown to over 133,000 members, <a href=\"https://elementor.com/\">Elementor is the biggest example of this</a>, and they are pivoting to redefine themselves accordingly. Their identity doesn\'t emphasize a WordPress plugin but a platform (and community) for Creators. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-f02749a6-c26d-4c1c-a349-444397d597d0\">That\'s where WordPress should be, and in a sense it is, but it uses the language of a 20 year-old open source project that is illegible to most people in their teens and twenties today. And if they look a little way into the very limited &#8220;WordPress news&#8221; space, Creators aren\'t going to see Creators there. Certainly not a wide range of artists and makers. They may see &#8220;drama&#8221; and arguments, or &#8220;inside-baseball&#8221; like this post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-b4807b88-ab9a-4ce7-9086-3d43929ede71\">Craft + Commerce and WordCamp US</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-60bdea77-3b00-4542-8adb-25b820780a7d\">I found Joe Casabona\'s &#8220;<a href=\"https://wpreview.io/a-tale-of-two-keynotes/\">Tale of Two Keynotes</a>&#8221; really helpful for understanding some key threats and opportunities WordPress needs to face in the context of today\'s Creator Economy. Joe\'s main point is that Creators focus on earning and growth in their businesses in a context where this message is encouraged and prioritized — and WordPress needs more of that. I\'m not opposed to that view, but it\'s not the main thing I got out of Joe\'s post and want to elaborate here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-3af73ea5-8fda-4846-8a60-557c2b9dc5ee\">Joe looks at the language ConvertKit founder Nathan Barry used to invite community participation in his last keynote for Craft + Commerce, a major conference aimed at Creators in his hometown of Boise, Idaho. Then he looks at the language of participation in Matt Mullenweg\'s speech in <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-comments-no-4-state-of-the-word-2021-analysis/\">the last State of the Word</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-fff2770d-4439-4673-9878-843a5481044a\">Barry emphasized goals that could be summed up as, &#8220;You can and should make a good living doing what you love in the creator economy!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Here are the <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-team-responses-to-the-state-of-the-word-2021/\">Post Status team responses to SotW 2021</a>. Rereading my own remarks, I\'m reminded of how optimistic that moment was — about all the same themes I\'m touching here.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-98dc48a3-e947-4e5f-8260-33984b488b5d\">Matt emphasized learning through contribution and the danger of more being taken out than given back. What stands out most in my memory is his &#8220;Give a penny, take a penny&#8221; analogy for open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-18f2b1bb-119f-47db-b4cf-0ec4cb188eec\">(That\'s not a knock on Matt, pennies, his analogy, or least of all the idea that you learn by doing — with others who know more. Post Status is all about that. We repeat &#8220;learn by helping&#8221; all the time. An example of this actually went out in our latest newsletter. But I do think &#8220;learn how to earn together&#8221; is a unique emphasis of the Post Status community within WordPress, and it is closer to Barry\'s language than anything as close to the project as Post Status is.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-2c2832da-0b83-467c-80a9-e5a11f17d025\">As he seemed to intend, Matt\'s keynote reminded me of the values of small towns at their best, where I\'ve lived about half my life. That part of me sees Barry as a bit of a huckster — sure, everyone\'s winner! What exactly is he giving you? Lifetime free access to ConvertKit? Or just high fives?</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-a1fad17e-5613-49e7-85d8-4783932d616c\">I don\'t see the two keynotes reflecting scarcity versus abundance thinking or even two very different attitudes, but if you wanted to polarize people over them you could. Pick on the vulnerabilities of one, and amplify the strengths of the other. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are strengths and limitations to both emphases — Creating and Contributing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-a1fad17e-5613-49e7-85d8-4783932d616c\">What if we tried to combine the strengths of the language of contribution with new, complementary ideas and language from the Creator Economy?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-145fb39a-674f-43b8-8c1f-67c8f17881cb\">&#8220;Creators&#8221; vs. &#8220;Contributors&#8221;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-9a877702-0b72-40e0-a837-7a43f5155548\">There are strengths and limitations attached to both of these words when they\'re used to define identity and participation in a creative community. <em>Creating</em> and <em>Contributing</em>. They don\'t seem very different until you take a close look.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Creating manages to hold together both ideas of giving <em>and</em> gaining. Creativity is about making things you care about deeply and are inspired to work on. When you create something it\'s a gift to everyone, potentially, and to yourself.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-254f7428-0dd8-4a8e-adfb-d7d3f458a8eb\">Contributing has distinct emphasis on giving, not getting back. It is a zero-sum transaction between a contributor and recipient of contributions. To use the language of contribution effectively, you probably have to be seen as truly having a greater need than the people you are asking to contribute more. Better yet, they should see themselves as implicitly benefiting from their contributions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-254f7428-0dd8-4a8e-adfb-d7d3f458a8eb\">If they don\'t believe this is true, repeating the old magic words will not work unless you do it live on air, interrupting normal programming until enough contributions have come in. Until next time. (Kind of like Admin Notifications used for upselling premium plugins.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-991b730c-d674-41c3-abf1-e7068185e881\">Creating manages to hold together both ideas of giving <em>and</em> gaining. Creativity is about making things you care about deeply and are inspired to work on. When you create something it\'s a gift to everyone, potentially, and to yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>So what should we do differently?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-9231192c-53a9-490f-b067-64e4d295c356\">Am I proposing a massive Search and Replace targeting all forms of the word &#8220;Contribute&#8221; in WordPress? Nope. I personally find calling people &#8220;Creators&#8221; more cringey than the older, grammatically tortured term, &#8220;Creatives.&#8221; But I recognize when I am out of date, and I am willing to adapt where I see value in doing so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-9231192c-53a9-490f-b067-64e4d295c356\">I\'m not proposing anything but that we think more carefully about language, tone, and audience. What we emphasize with one word or story as opposed to another may close or open doors with different people. It\'s good to have a lot of options to engage a lot of people. It\'s good to be flexible and adaptable. It\'s good to know what connects and unites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-e55a849a-8cf5-48f7-b311-570266746adf\">Do we know?<br /><br />Can we create it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-2d71356b-5b29-428e-a3e8-3618cb28851a\">Can we teach it to each other?</p>\n<p>\"<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/lets-not-lose-the-creator-economy/\">Languages of Contribution and Creation</a>\" by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com/author/dan-knauss/\">Dan Knauss</a> was first published at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com\">Post Status - The Community for WordPress Professionals</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 03:28:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: Join the WordPress World Photography Day Challenge\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137161\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wptavern.com/join-the-wordpress-world-photography-day-challenge\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3044:\"<img />photo credit: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/author/chrisedwardsce/\">ChrisEdwardsCE</a>\n\n\n\n<p>In celebration of World Photography Day, WordPress&#8217; Photo Directory team has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/photos/2022/08/18/wordpress-world-photography-day-challenge-2022/\">issued a challenge</a> designed to get people contributing:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>Submit a photo that captures something unique about your local area</strong>, in a way that helps represent the geographic diversity of the WordPress community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its launch, the WordPress Photo Directory has grown to 3,633 free, CC0-licensed photos. The purpose of this challenge is to raise awareness of the directory project and encourage people to contribute photos to expand the collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo contributors are encouraged to submit an original image of something from their local area (neighborhood, town, city, or country), such as a landscape, street, local wildlife, nature, or a landmark. In addition to following the directory guidelines, participants should also add the following information to denote their work as part of this initiative: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>(1) The location or where the image was taken (e.g. the city and/or country)</li><li>(2) The word WorldPhotographyDay22</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Photo Directory team contributor Marco Almeida has an additional recommendation for well-known locations that have an English counterpart for the name in the original language:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Quick suggestion for submissions: if you’re uploading a photo that has regional interest and the name of the place is not the same in English and the local language, do repeat the photo description in both languages. For example: “<em>Walking on Lisbon’s sidewalk &#8211; A andar na calçada de Lisboa</em>”. This will ensure the photo is both searchable by “Lisbon” and “Lisboa”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Submitted photos that are approved may be featured across WordPress.org&#8217;s social media channels. Photo contributors will also get a contributor badge on their WordPress.org profiles, which I was surprised to find on mine after contributing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/26962070d8/\">a picture of my morning oatmeal</a> a few months ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Participants can submit up to five photos at a time but will have to wait until those pass through review before submitting more. If your photo is approved, the Photo Directory team requests you leave a comment on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/photos/2022/08/18/wordpress-world-photography-day-challenge-2022/\">challenge post</a> with the link to the photo and the story behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More specific instructions for submitting photos are available in the announcement. If you are a photography enthusiast, this challenge is a great opportunity to give back to the world of free WordPress resources. The challenge will conclude on August 28, 2022.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 20 Aug 2022 01:24:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WPTavern: YITH Wonder: A New Free WordPress Theme with Support for WooCommerce and Full-Site Editing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137134\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://wptavern.com/yith-wonder-a-new-free-wordpress-theme-with-support-for-woocommerce-and-full-site-editing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3194:\"<p><a href=\"https://yithemes.com/\">YITH</a>, a WooCommerce plugin development company that was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/newfold-digital-acquires-yith-to-expand-woocommerce-expertise\">acquired by Newfold Digital</a> in March 2022,  has released its first block theme on WordPress.org. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/yith-wonder/\">YITH Wonder</a> is now listed among 122 other <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">block themes</a> that support full-site editing and have recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-directory-adds-block-themes-to-filter-menu\">gained their own menu link in the directory</a> to improve their visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>YITH Wonder includes 24 different patterns &#8211; many of them aimed at shops. Since the company specializes in WooCommerce products, it&#8217;s no surprise that YITH Wonder offers corresponding styles for WooCommerce products, shop pages, cart, and checkout.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The theme also includes three full-page patterns for different homepage layouts and designs. These are very helpful for quickly putting together a page without having to hunt for and place each pattern in the right place. The full-page patterns can easily be previewed on the theme&#8217;s listing on WordPress.org: (<a href=\"https://wp-themes.com/yith-wonder/?page_id=2&pattern_name=yith-wonder/homepage-1\">Homepage 1</a>, <a href=\"https://wp-themes.com/yith-wonder/?page_id=2&pattern_name=yith-wonder/homepage-2\">Homepage 2</a>, and <a href=\"https://wp-themes.com/yith-wonder/?page_id=2&pattern_name=yith-wonder/homepage-3\">Homepage 3)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>YITH Wonder comes with six different style variations that make it easy to change the the accent color combinations and typography for the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://wonder.yithemes.com/ecommerce/\">live demo</a> on the theme&#8217;s website. One handy feature on the demo is that you can click &#8220;Launch Sandbox&#8221; to instantly spin up a test site with the theme and WooCommerce pre-loaded. The sandbox sites expire after one hour. This gives a user the opportunity to explore the full-site editing features and see if the theme will work for their particular use case. For example, users can see how the WooCommerce product catalog template will look with their own customizations applied. The theme packages two dozen different templates and template parts that can be customized inside the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>YITH Wonder is listed as a multi-purpose WordPress theme in the directory but it really shines as one of the few free block-based themes built with WooCommerce in mind. Creating a new page and slapping one of the full-page patterns on it is a delightful experience that will save users time in getting started and also enable them to build targeted pages featuring different product categories or sale items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/yith-wonder/\">YITH Wonder</a> is available to download on WordPress.org for free. I couldn&#8217;t find any documentation for the theme, but it may be available once the company formally announces the theme on the YITH website.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Aug 2022 21:29:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 65) — How We Talk When We Talk About WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=106145\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://poststatus.com/how-we-talk-when-we-talk-about-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53009:\"<div class=\"wp-container-29 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">What\'s it like to enter the WordPress community media space, especially as the editor of a publication with many voices, personalities, and perspectives? </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"yoast-reading-time__wrapper\"><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__icon\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__spacer\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__descriptive-text\">Estimated reading time:  </span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__reading-time\">3</span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__time-unit\"> minutes</span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">My friend and dialogue partner, <strong>Nyasha Green</strong>, is six months into her role as Editorial Director at <strong>MasterWP</strong>, so today we\'re talking about what that\'s been like for Ny, what she\'s learned, and how we look at the WordPress media space we both work in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly we talk about conflict, communication, personality, and the importance of in-person events.

How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Good. Good. Pretty good for, uh, winding in towards the end of the week. I know. Um, let\'s see, your, your newsletter from master VP goes out Tuesday in our productions Friday. So maybe you can, it goes out Wednesday. Oh Wednesday now. Okay. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tuesday, Tuesdays. You\'re getting it already. Yeah. Okay. So you\'re kind of, is this the down slope for you? easier time,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> eh, yeah, it is. It is. The beginning of the week is always like, alright, make sure everything\'s together. And then it\'s like, ah, you know, breathe and like can hop in and getting ready for next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it definitely is. And it\'s almost Friday. Yeah. All good news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah, for us it\'s like, yeah, it\'s the, the high, when you get it all done on, on Friday and then the weekend. So, um, you\'ve been at it for about six months. I read your your six month. Article, uh, post [00:01:00] there and reflection on all the stuff you, you guys have done in that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah. How are you, how are you feeling about, um, about not just doing master WP, but this is kind of a new thing for you jumping straight into the, um, the WordPress community as someone who\'s, um, you know, come, come in from, uh, not that, not that long ago for the first. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. So, um, I\'ve had, I have a experience in WordPress, so I\'ve been coding in WordPress for a couple years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I\'ve been writing and editing for what 16 years. Um, and just, yeah, putting it all together to be like a part of the community to be a part of the writing, to be a part of, you know, everything that\'s going on. Um, it has been. Fun. I don\'t wanna say that first. It\'s been very fun. Um, it\'s also been very entertaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it\'s been [00:02:00] very interesting. Um, Hmm. It\'s been. Oh, oh, it\'s been just a journey. And, um, it\'s just been six months, but I\'ve learned a lot. I\'ve met a lot of really good people and I\'ve got to do, I\'ve gotten to do a lot of really cool things. Um, I\'m really excited for the rest of this, the next six months. I\'m just I\'m ready for that year article, like to just talk about everything we did in a year, um, But, um, I think the most interesting thing about it is, um, just, just getting to know so many people in the community, not just in the community, because like I was, I\'ve been in the community for years as a coder, but I haven\'t been like, you know, an active participant in like, as far as meeting people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So meeting active people in the community has been really awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, that\'s really different. Isn\'t it? I, I relate. It\'s a lot. I feel, um, I, I feel similarly because despite going back early long way with open source and, and WordPress [00:03:00] site, I probably got more involved long ago in other communities and I\'ve stayed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stayed for a long time in a, you know, relatively quiet, neutral space relative to, to post status and, and, um, and just, um, my own work for a long time. But it\'s, yeah, it\'s relatively recently that my role has kind of expanded and changed and re not, I wouldn\'t say required, but made it natural to, um, and if not, Necessary to, uh, you know, be more engaged in social media and, um, and just, yeah, the kind of networking that, that comes around from that and the, the way that people, uh, connect with you more when you\'re, you\'re taking more of a public role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah. There\'s ups and downs, ups and downs to that. How, how do you, what, what do you see the pros and cons [00:04:00] or what have been the highs and lows for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, the pros would be the people I\'ve met, um, as a relative newcomer to the community and someone that\'s trying to get more people in, um, being, you know, editorial director of master WP has opened me to so many resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many people that want to help in this community. And I feel like that does not, nobody really talks about that. That doesn\'t, uh, that never makes it out of the screams. Drama whatever\'s going on that week in WordPress, but there are so many people that want to help the community, especially newbies, but they don\'t know how, or they they\'re more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will, I have resources for you to help, which is still helping. And I was able to connect with a lot of people. Um, I have been given a lot of resources for just starting my own word, press meetups in my city. I was just living in and the city I\'m doing now. People just they\'ve read and they\'ve seen things I\'ve [00:05:00] doing they\'re let me start over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'ve read things I\'ve written and they\'ve seen things I\'m doing and that spurred them to help. So it\'s been mostly positive. Um, for me. Great. Um, some of the cons is, um, something I, I\'m not new to leadership. I\'m not new to taking ownership of things. I\'ve had my own business before, things like that. Um, I guess the biggest thing for me is when master WP gets negative, press.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that\'s all people wanna talk about to me. Uh, if they talk about that, amongs the self that\'s, whatever that\'s it\'s okay. But when lots of really positive things happen, like I said, like me gaining these resources, us having, helping new people get into the community, people, uh, you know, changing their tune on things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They just didn\'t have information about which we\'ve, we\'ve been told all of us that that\'s helped at least someone, no, it is nothing. Nobody really wants to talk about it. And it could be because negative stuff, you know, people aren\'t louder when they\'re negative. Versus they\'re a little bit more [00:06:00] quiet when they\'re positive, but that\'s something that it didn\'t bother me at first, but it was overwhelming after a little while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm. Because. I\'m a person, like if it\'s something\'s negative, that\'s going on, I would like to work with you on it. But I quickly discovered a lot of people don\'t want that. They just wanna be negative and, you know, yeah. So navigating that\'s been interesting. Um, and then we, we, we shifted a lot. Master WP is completely different than what it was under.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the old ownership. And I think a lot of people had a problem with that as well. Um, especially when we talked about race and diversity and oh, my favorite giving people money. I understand that. Cuz I talk about that in regular life. I\'ve been a community organizer for years. I do community service. Um, and I don\'t, I don\'t have to answer to an organization to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do stuff out of my own pocket. That\'s how I am. So this stuff is not new to me. Um, but it\'s, it\'s interesting to see people [00:07:00] take on those. You shouldn\'t be helping people or you shouldn\'t be doing. In a space where they constantly is, need a need for help. So I\'ve, I\'ve learned a lot. It\'s it\'s it helps me ponder and wonder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I, I don\'t know. I\'m just, I\'m very interested to see what else I learned because six months, depending on who you talk to is not a long time. I don\'t feel like that was a long time, but I poof I\'ve learned a lot. So this year should be pretty epic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah. You really jump right in and yeah, when you do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public like that. And you\'re, you\'re putting out the kind of material you do on, um, writing and, and podcasting mm-hmm um, yeah, you get, you get a lot, learn a lot from getting a lot of reactions fast and when you become the news it\'s, it\'s not, not awesome. I have a little experience with that. But yeah, no one can really control the message all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, [00:08:00] uh, being able to roll with that is, is good. But, um, yeah, I hope the, the positives outweigh the negatives. Where, where do you think the, um, some of the pushback or raised hackles? Come from, is it just, who are you to say, just where does this new, you know, just reaction of, of established or familiar, um, people who are familiar with the space and, and feel really, um, comfortable in it, the way it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I don\'t know who you are. You just come out of, you know, you\'re offering new perspectives and, you know, different, different takes on things or, um, is that. Is that just kind of the newcomer, um, challenge that I don\'t know, human social groups always seem to, to</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> have. Oh, I would be surprised if that wasn\'t playing a part into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, because, um, some people I have talked [00:09:00] with interviewed, you know, written to they\'ve written to me, you know, they\'ve been in this community like. Years and years while I might have been still been in high school, things like that. So I definitely, I, I could see some of that. Definitely. Um, I guess the big thing is nobody really addresses a lot of negative issues with me, which, which I\'m totally prepared for as editorial director.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I it\'s, it\'s always secondhand stuff. And it\'s like, how do you address that? I\'m one of these people, like I said, I address things and that people take that in a negative way. I don\'t understand that. Like I. I have always been able to communicate with people. If there\'s a issue, I think we can solve it if we talk about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don\'t think a lot of people have that point of view. They don\'t want to talk, they don\'t wanna solve issues. They just want you to know they are not feeling it. And that\'s also fun. But, you know, as a person who\'s a doer, I can only accept so much of that, you know, send it to me, but what do you want me to do with it after a while it\'s gonna be my response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so it, [00:10:00] you know, there. I\'m a newbie, you know, we\'re new, I guess we\'re as a whole newish people on the scene. Um, although Rob and Brian and a lot of our, uh, developers have been in WordPress years. Mm-hmm um, there\'s also I don\'t know what I I\'ll call it. I always try to make up my own names for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it\'s getting into the group. I guess liking what everyone else likes and hating what everyone else hates, which we, we won\'t do. And master WP is right. Individual people. We, we also, that\'s a big issue too. We get, if Rob has an issue on something, that means we all think it, if Brian has an issue on something that makes we all think it, if I have an issue with something that means we all think it and, um, that\'s not true at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. We are very open and diverse about that, but that, that gets lost too. So I think it\'s. , you know, we\'re not as a whole waiting and liking the right things. I can tell you as a person, an individual that will never be me. I\'ve never been able to do that. [00:11:00] Friends, family work. Yeah. I\'ve never been able to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it won\'t be me, but, um, I think that plays a part into it too. And then I just think, you know, We\'re saying things that some people have told me privately, they wanna say, but they can\'t. So it\'s a number of things which I am so interested and totally down to explore in the next six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> That\'s good curiosity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>helps, especially with, with negatives. Um, yeah. Why in, instead of just hardening up or closing off or writing people off, um, there\'s always something to learn. You know, it occurred to me listening. what you\'re, um, saying there about a publication with a lot of voices. Mm-hmm um, it occurs to me that there isn\'t we, and we talk about this a lot, the WordPress news space or whatever you want to call it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s pretty small. Mm-hmm and um, most of the people in it are, you know, we\'re pretty [00:12:00] small team at post status, but, um, there\'s, there\'s multiple voices and we, we aspire to. To have that, um, kind of sense of dialogue, but a lot of people are just doing, you know, it\'s one, one person, one personality. And so you, you get kind of used to their perspective on things mm-hmm , mm-hmm and maybe there\'s not as much of a familiarity with, um, in, in the space with, um, Hey, this is a publication where we actually want to have a lot of D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People and different diversity of views and they may not stack up or align and it\'s not planned. It\'s not to, to do so. It\'s not meant to, um, push a certain stance, but yeah, inevitably there are some kind of ranges of opinion that a, a publication will kind of get known, known for. Mm-hmm um, I wonder if that\'s just too new of a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don\'t [00:13:00] distinguish between, oh, who wrote this? Who wrote that? Um, yeah, I think that can, that can easily be part of it, but, um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> you know, I didn\'t, you pray up a good point. I didn\'t, I, I did not. And we have talked about this, but I never really, I didn\'t, I didn\'t think about that. You just like enlighten me at that moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are, uh, a lot of publications where it\'s not as many people. Getting a platform to talk about this many different things. So that could be very confusing to readers and people consuming our media. And that\'s. Thank you. That\'s something we need to work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Thank you. Yeah. And, and a lot of, a lot of those individual voices have kind of been typecast, maybe unfairly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think sometimes even individuals change their views, moderate them, come to new opinions and things. But over time people tend, oh, this podcast, he thinks this way, she, she looks that way. [00:14:00] Um, That might be some of it. And, and also everyone\'s just guilty going so fast, having so much going by how, how deeply do we read or listen to things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. And we just kinda box people up quickly. Yes. Um, I, I, I, I think we\'re in personality. We\'re probably a bit alike in that, you know, liking a certain amount of. Friction and difference to have some have things to talk about, um, to learn from something that\'s not familiar or someone who doesn\'t agree with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yeah. Um, yeah. And you guys actually, you know, pay for advertise that you want, you disagree with this. You, we pay you just as much to write for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah. Come pay. We\'ll pay you $300 an article to come disagree with us and yeah. S I\'m hearing again, secondhand. So many people have these disagreements and I\'m like, why not get, get paid for it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s my dream to go disagree with people and get paid for it. Like if [00:15:00] someone had given me this opportunity when I was younger, I probably would be a lawyer because I would be so good at arguing with people. but, uh, yeah, we do because we do, we want to. Opposing views. Like we don\'t all, and we all don\'t agree with each other, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I love BTS. Brian does it. Um, Rob has his views on multisite. I\'m indifferent to it. , you know, we, but we all get labeled, like, you know, oh, if that\'s Rob\'s idea, then it\'s our idea. And I, I don\'t completely blame the community for that because that\'s life. Right. You know, when you think about, well, it\'s you think about like companies, sometimes companies get, um, mislabeled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I, I like to use the New York times as an example. Like the New York times is pretty progressive. Most of the time left leaning, in my opinion, that\'s subjective. And they will run op-eds with conservative point of views and Republicans and things like that. And they get crucified and it\'s like, everybody forgets that , they\'re running different opinions all the [00:16:00] time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, I, I think that\'s that\'s life sometimes too, so I don\'t take it personally. And, um, right. It\'s something we can always work on. I\'m always open to working on things. Yeah. And that\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> what you get from a democratized publication space that no, one\'s able to squash out one particular voice and, and ideally it, they can be in some kind of productive dialogue with each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I, I think too listening to if, if you go, if your publication is, and, and a lot of, a lot of the. WordPress space is, is geared towards what\'s the drama of the day or what\'s, you know, what\'s the controversy up here. The, um, I wonder how much of it has to do with like energy levels, cause that stuff can raise energy and levels, expenditure and anxiety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, and it also, there\'s a cognitive load to who is this? Who wrote this? Do I know them? Who are, you know, there\'s all this, it, it takes real effort to. To make that three dimensional to [00:17:00] make that connect, um, more deeply. And, and I think that\'s just what happens on the, on the internet, unless you make the effort or, you know, you meet it at word camp or something, something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\'t, you don\'t have context. And, um, I understand you don\'t want to deal with, um, a lot of noise some of the time. And, um, since I\'m not really running. Opinion or oriented, um, publication and actually going slow and focusing on more business pragmatics, a lot of the time and avoiding drama. That\'s, that\'s kind of what our longstanding, um, Attributes that people like that I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> thinks for the special sauce where\'s in that Dan where\'s oh, actually life is meant to be fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I [00:18:00] like to have fun. risk. Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> it\'s in, it\'s in there. I think it, I think it just comes SL it comes slower and. When you\'re able to do more listening and, and cover a lot of things, not just like what is going on in the core project, but, or automatic, but there\'s a whole ecosystem. There\'s little fish and big fish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there\'s middle, middle sized ones. There\'s, there\'s all these different, um, concerns around the. The commons around, uh, WordPress that everyone has in common as they\'re what they\'re basing their business on in some way. So I don\'t know. I don\'t, I don\'t, I don\'t, I think that\'s fun too. It\'s a different kind though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and, and it doesn\'t, uh, it\'s, it\'s definitely, um, definitely a different maintains, a different mood. Um, but. [00:19:00] Yeah. What do do you, do you think that there\'s a, there\'s a, a regular current, we need to maintain in this space where there\'s critical questioning, um, a kind of dialogue going on that, um, that hits maybe some of the bigger, um, Bigger tougher questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Nope. I think people should be able to say whatever they want, you know, um, as long as it\'s not hate speech and no one yells bomb in a crowded theater, that\'s my opinion on that. Um, no, one\'s even when. Profess your love of things. People are going to disagree. I think no matter what you write, people are going to dis disagree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as you said, post status, you know, y\'all, y\'all have a pretty neutral stance on things and y\'all do a good job of it. And people still disagree with you. So, oh yeah. Um, no, I mean, you know, so it\'s like, there\'s no ways to avoid it. I don\'t think there\'s a plan for that, but, um, I don\'t, I don\'t, I don\'t [00:20:00] know the, I guess I\'m ponding that answer as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s something I\'m thinking about, but until then, I\'m not going to, you know, limit anyone. I want them to speak about everything. If we could talk about everything everywhere all at once, I would love that, but being realistic, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Yeah. I wasn\'t suggesting it\'d be a limit limited in some way, but that, um, just the, the, this, the public, the WordPress public sphere, I say sometimes, you know, kind of the, the debate, um, arena, the public square it\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not always in the greatest shape, especially now you might, might, might exist. um, is there, is there work to be done there where there are unavoidable differences, disagreements, big thorny questions that do need to be maintain? Yeah. There [00:21:00] needs to be some dialogue maintained about those. And is that kind of more, what you\'re you\'re tackling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, honestly, no. Um, but because this is the thing and I, I\'m not just, just saying it for you. It\'s something I had to work with too. We\'re all. We\'re all from different places. We have different cultural backgrounds and we have different, even if we have the same cultural background, we have different upbringings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re different people. I don\'t think there\'s going to be a uniform way to do that with so many different personalities. I\'m not saying, you know, if it could be done. Sure. I just don\'t think it can be done. Um, we\'re also different. And I think honestly, if we embrace that more people wouldn\'t be, as you know, what\'s the word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it wouldn\'t come off as, um, antagonistic. Is that a word? Did I make that up? Yeah. Yeah. I think people wouldn\'t be, be like that, but it\'s, it\'s like, okay, this person is this type of way. And we\'re just gonna write [00:22:00] them off as oh, that\'s them? No, let\'s, let\'s bring \'em in. Let\'s see why they\'re that way let\'s work together in this, this, this community, like a community should, um, if we\'re a community, a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They take, they take care of each other, they\'re they, you know, even their craziest member. Well, I gotta stop saying that. Um, even their members that we think are eccentric or we think are not like us, we take care of our, we take care of our own. And, um, I don\'t see that in the WordPress community. I see. Oh, that\'s just the way they are when that person could be one of the greatest people you\'ve ever made in your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you gave it a chance, um, or they could be horrible, but you know, what are we gonna do? We\'re gonna try. We\'re gonna not try. We\'re gonna give. Are we a community or not?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, that, that\'s kind of what I mean, like, do you see yourself as kind of in your mission to, to try to create an inclusive space?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s not one person or one, you know, organization or just one particular agenda and on any issue, [00:23:00] but, um, open kind of the open stage, um, ally, ally kind of brought that up. What was the mm-hmm the, um, podcast episode she did recently where. She talked, she called it debate club, which to me sounds a little little on the antagonistic side of, and she meant it more on, you know, like back in the olden days when maybe high, high school debate clubs were, were, uh, not, not as, uh, intense as I imagine they might be now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, just a space where, where you can, um, you. You can try out different ideas and it\'s, you know, it\'s not to be taken personally like this is, we\'re gonna try to, what\'s the best case you can make for this. What\'s the best way to look at this issue. And, and then how does someone who totally takes it another way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do they respond to it? Is that the kind of, would that be like a healthy, healthy thing [00:24:00] that you guys are shooting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> we don\'t have a uniform goal. So that\'s, that\'s again, a thing like is master WP. Doesn\'t have a, a, a one thing we\'re all trying to do. Um, so I mean, if you\'re asking me personally, um, I, again, I don\'t think that\'s possible because the people are so different and, um, I wanna just spin that on. Like, I\'m not saying like, everybody is like so different from me and I just feel overwhelmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I meet a. Uh, kindred spirits in the community. Um, but it\'s just like, even when you just said like, you know, debate club was kind of harsh, that was like probably the most, I think, polite thing you can say. I can\'t think of anything polite or to say and that\'s not anything wrong with you. That\'s just something I have to look at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, um, I try to, I\'m trying to make my language more accessible. Like not say things like crazy, like it tears me up to say that like, so, you know, that\'s something, um, I think, you know, I wanna work on, but also like I [00:25:00] don\'t, I don\'t know. That\'s something I\'ve never thought about. That\'s a that\'s Ally\'s idea and, you know, ally works with master WP, but we, we haven\'t talked about that as a whole, as master WP because master WP lets everybody express themselves and be their own person and have their own ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Not saying no one else does, but yeah. Um, I don\'t think it\'s possible me. Naisha saying that now the rest of my team may have different thoughts on that. And actually I think that\'s really awesome. And I want to talk to Allie about it. I wanna talk to my team about it. So, um, yeah, I\'ll definitely talk to them about it, but, um, I just don\'t see it as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also don\'t see it as necessary. Um, I don\'t, I don\'t, people are always going to yell and Twitter has given people the ability to yell from their homes. Like, you know, it\'s people who would yell at about stuff and complain and say things. They would never say if they had to say it in public, Twitter has given them that space and right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can\'t really take it away. Um, so I don\'t know Dan, to answer your question. I don\'t think it\'ll work, but I don\'t, I don\'t like saying nothing will work. I think everything should at least be [00:26:00] tried. Hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, I think, yeah, the more good models there are, um, the better, yeah, like checking, checking ourselves on the, what seems like crazy far out irrational, extreme opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, that\'s just, so that\'s such a common feature of when things get bad in a, in a community, um, inability to talk because. You\'re, you know, some other perspective is just so far, far out. And, uh, that, that may be the case. Maybe things are, you know, really that broken sometimes. But I would like to think, and I, I don\'t think they are in, um, something like in an open source community like WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you just kind of have to give people that, that tolerance. Forbearance is a good word. Um, and step back from, you know, recognizing this, okay. I don\'t know where they\'re coming [00:27:00] from. This doesn\'t make sense. I\'m gonna try to find out, I\'m gonna try to understand it from their point of view rather than oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, call it just nuts. Um, yeah, I think that\'s hard to do when we don\'t, we don\'t have a space where that, um, seems to happen. A lot. And it reminds me, it actually reminds me of way back when I did a lot with Jula kind of when they\'re at their high point and then over it, um, it\'s a lot, it was a lot similar to WordPress in that, um, They developed a, a third party plugin theme ecosystem is where there are a lot of people making good money and agencies and so on, and who really feel in invested in, in the product and then very, sometimes alienated from where it\'s going and how decisions get made and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and. That kind of language emerged, like just complete your perspective is so far out from mine clearly. , [00:28:00] it\'s, it\'s, um, not worth any time to try to understand. And yeah. Do you see that kind of thing going on? Is that something we can help in, in some way, is that just helped by letting more people. Have the</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> floor, more people need to be elevated in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Um, I get asked to do a lot of podcasts and things, you know, like what we\'re doing now. Sometimes I just say no, because I don\'t think I should be the only voice. I don\'t think I should be the only one talking for master WP. I don\'t think I should be the. No, nobody\'s like done this, but in, uh, outside of nobody\'s done this in the WordPress community, but outside of the WordPress community, I don\'t think I should be the black person you go to talk to about, about black issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think, um, Once I, I, you know, I, I have my voice and if I wanna say something and if I wanna talk to people, I can do it. Um, but other than that, I think we should be elevating people. I think if the community was a little bit more diverse, I know I say that all the [00:29:00] time, people would know how to deal with opposing opinions, from different people who may be from different backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see that I see it as diversity issue. I see some of the same people who click together, not agreeing with some of the other people who were the same and click together. And I\'m like, if you guys didn\'t do that, maybe you wouldn\'t be so upset all the time, but I don\'t know. What do I know? I\'m new. I\'m I\'m joking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, I guess would the, would there be a space where everybody could just be, not use bad language or threatening language and it\'d be like a little safer space for people. Again, culturally, I, I think that\'s impossible. Um, because you know, my, you could disagree with me as long as you don\'t cuss at me or yell at me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can disagree with me all day, but that\'s not with other people. It\'s like, you can\'t use certain word and completely understandable. You can\'t use certain words with me. You do that. That\'s that\'s, that\'s why I tap out. We have to learn that about each other. And if like, if [00:30:00] nobody\'s willing to learn that, and I mean, on both sides of people who don\'t want you to use any strong language, don\'t wanna learn that about other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, you know, strong language is not a big red flag to them. And I think people are misunderstanding each other. They\'re like, wow, he\'s, you know, they are just so threatening toward me. And they\'re like, I thought we were having a regular conversation or maybe on the other side of that, like, you know, I, I just it\'s people need to talk to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it\'s communication problem. It\'s a diversity problem. It\'s communication problem. If we want those spaces to happen, people need to talk to each other. I don\'t see a lot of people talking to each other in the C. unless they agree with each other and that\'s bad in any community,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> right? Yeah. The absence of, of any, any friction there, it\'s, it\'s a tough mm-hmm seeming paradox of the absence of, of conflict tends to indicate a problem because people are just individuals and, and different and you, and you need that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need questions and [00:31:00] friction to be. To come up with better ideas and to grow, to grow, to see things that you didn\'t wouldn\'t otherwise see. And, and if you\'re repressing all of that, it\'s gonna blow up some more dysfunctional way. Oh yeah. So yeah, the high conflict personality, I think in. Psychology is, is actually someone who, who just doesn\'t doesn\'t have any repertoire of responses to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s a normal part of life and they try to avoid it and try to suppress it. And that actually causes more conflict than they just don\'t have the tools to, um, to deal with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Do you think, uh, maybe I, I have a question. I\'m sorry. You said high conflict people. Yeah. Right. Who, what would, uh, be your definition of high conflict people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I\'ll tell you mine, and then I can tell you, and then we can talk. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I think, I think the psychological model, um, that I dimly have read about is, um, it, you, it is [00:32:00] just the simple definition would be someone who ends up in conflict a lot. Um, and maybe they don\'t know why , um, mm-hmm they may not think they are because they\'re trying to avoid it all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm and. you know, like, um, say like the worst example would be like, you know, estrangement in a family or something like that. Mm-hmm so these two people don\'t talk mm-hmm at all. That\'s not a condition of detachment or peace. Uh it\'s a, it\'s a cold, it\'s a simmering thing that will go off as soon as they get together or something triggers it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So mm-hmm um, Yeah, high conflict tends to come from not being able to manage reasonable levels of conflict in reasonable ways, because that\'s just what human groups require.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> You don\'t think like most of what you said is kind of subjective though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh, sure. , it\'s just a, a model, uh, a hypothesis, I guess,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> but like, I, I think I could fit into [00:33:00] that because I, like I said, when I told tell people, like I address things, people can take that as like, if.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\'ll like yell at you. If you say something to her, I can say, but it\'s not that I like to talk to people like positive, or it could be positive or negative. You could come to me and say, oh my God, ni I just had the great day ever. And I\'m gonna say what happened? Let\'s talk about it. You could come to me and say, I just had the worst day ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m like, dude, what happened? Let\'s talk about it. My responses will not change. Um, but just people who address things because we\'re in a community, we\'re in a society. , we\'re in a place where. People are very nonconfrontational. They are very nonconfrontational in the text space, not even just WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So I, I could come off as like confrontational or aggressive and I\'m not I\'m I will, my responses will be the same. I just, yeah. I like, I\'m curious. I told you, I\'m a naturally curious person. I ask you like 50 million questions a day and you always answer, and I appreciate you. and I, I, that, but that could be taken the wrong way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s [00:34:00] like, I\'m not a psychiatry person or psych psychological person. I can\'t look into all these things to see how we should treat these different people. And that, I just think we should have more opposing or diverse thoughts so we can, you know, get more people who are not just like in a echo chamber together, and then we can grow and make changes from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We just, there\'s no way we\'re gonna get to a point where everybody\'s nice to each other because nice is subjective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Well, yeah, and there\'s a lot of culture in it too. I, I think what in the way I I\'m looking at it, um, the way you describe yourself and, um, I would probably fit in that, in that too, is, is not a high conflict personality, but people might who, because, because you\'re a pressure valve because you\'re, you\'re, you\'re not gonna bury stuff or, and it\'s not that big of a deal to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. But the per the person who\'s trying to avoid. Conflict that every turn is suppressing. What they really think is suppressing, [00:35:00] uh, things that probably matter a lot to them. And you don\'t even know. And then boom, it comes out at one point that\'s. Oh yeah. That\'s a really negative kind of conflict to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if, I don\'t know, you keep it kind of at a Luke warm level. A lot of the time, it\'s not, you know, that\'s pretty good. I\'m I\'m originally from the, the Northeast and. And there\'s , there\'s generally more time, especially in the Metro Northern New Jersey, New York, um, region there it\'s um, it\'s, uh, it\'s probably looked on as, as high conflict personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s aggressive. aggressive. Yeah. Drive. Sure. Learning to drive in, in New Jersey is fun. Um but it\'s actually, it gives you a lot of, it\'s a lot of tolerance. It\'s a lot of space because you can, people can push each other a long way and it\'s, and they have a lot of options to, um, , there\'s a lot of moves you can make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and a lot of it is. You know, [00:36:00] it\'s just, it\'s just talk it just Jerry Feld, people like to talk um, but then, you know, moving to the Midwest or the south at different times, totally different thing. And people don\'t interpret, um, you know, the threshold that they have for tolerating. Um, Um, open disagreement or questioning is lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh. So low differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> And , they love me here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yeah. I mean, I kind of missed the Southern ways of, of kind of. Backhanded dealing with</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> things. I don\'t miss this. We see we, we are opposing each other again. I, I love that New Jersey, New York, Boston way of, of being of talking to people because it\'s, you know me to understand it\'s it\'s so it\'s genuine, like here, like people could be talking to you and hate your gut, so you\'d never know oh, bless your heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So awesome. Like, [00:37:00] oh God, I hate that. Those are fighting words. So again, like someone might say, bless your heart. Oh, they\'re they\'re blessing you. I\'m like, no, they wanna fight. I\'m just kidding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I got used to it. I don\'t know it, but it\'s, it\'s a way of everyone knows is they\'re putting it off to the side. I, I never really figured out the, the Midwest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, doesn\'t really have anywhere for it to go and that, uh, that\'s a problem. I don\'t have a lot of west coast experience. I don\'t get it at all then. Oh, I love the west.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> You don\'t like the west coast. We disagreeing again. Dan, we\'re supposed to be, I don\'t</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> know. I\'m just saying I\'m neutral. I mean, I hardly, I\'ve only been there a few times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m kind of probably biased against Southern California car, all that. I probably like the north in the bay area, but we\'re gonna, we\'ll actually meet each other. In San Diego so we can, yes, we can check it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> that\'s gonna be fun now that you say that I love the voice closed. The people are so laid back in my opinion.[00:38:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re so laid back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> that\'s the reputation. It just, yeah. Is there, is there something else going on underneath? I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> That is so funny to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>huh? Insidious Californians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, yeah, it\'s a big, well, that\'s, it\'s a huge, we generalize like that. So these it\'s like GDP of a top, one of the largest countries, big population, very first, every respect and yeah, WordPress is, it\'s like California. It\'s like, like any big country. It\'s just, I think the diversity is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not, yeah, it\'s in, it\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> in. I\'m</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> sorry. There\'s there\'s not, there\'s a lot of underrepresentation of mm-hmm underrepresented groups. We that\'s definitely there, but there\'s huge diversity in the types of personalities and people and what their [00:39:00] experiences are and how they came into WordPress and how their business works and what ships they\'ve got on their shoulder or what words will trigger them off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don\'t know that, that stuff until you get up pretty, pretty close and. Yeah, I don\'t, I don\'t know if there\'s much we can do, um, podcasts or articles to, uh, smooth that process of, um, connection. I think that\'s more of an in person thing, your, your meetups that you\'re starting are probably most important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mentoring, you know, gets people together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. But I mean, if it\'s me mentoring and you. I have this stigma against me who people really be happy about that. not saying I do. I\'m just saying, um, just adding on what you said about diversity. Um, we need more diverse people too. I know we had diversity diverse minds, but if we were as diverse as Iowa am comfortable with every podcast I would get asked on, wouldn\'t be led by [00:40:00] white men.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s been one, there\'s only been one I\'ve been. Or been asked to be beyond that wasn\'t led by white man, and it was led by alley my homie alley. So it\'s like, yeah, that\'s not diverse. That\'s that\'s not it at all. Um, diverse minds. Yeah. What do those mind, what are those minds attached to so I I\'ll, um, I think we need to go a little further with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think, I think we need to go a little further with that, but, um, I lost my thought. I\'m sorry. We need to go further. We need to go further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Definitely. And well, yeah, I think you\'ve affected change in that area. Winston, I think was early voice there and Allie and love her and you and love her. Um, yeah, I mean all people I, I hope to meet, um, and getting, um, kind of beginning to normalize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would you call it? Uh, travel [00:41:00] scholarships. Um, and yeah, you know, you wanna have underrepresented people here. Well, let\'s, let\'s meet the needs. Let\'s actually talk about that. I kind of like it\'s, it\'s too bad that, um, people are kind of desperate for getting tickets to word, word, camp us. Um, but I kind of like the fact that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are talking more openly about, um, about the process, you know, there\'s the whole what\'s, when are you going? What, what days? And all of this stuff, that\'s kind of all out, out in the open rather than just, um, I don\'t remember seeing that quite so much. It</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> used to be as like a secret, what was it? Tell me about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I don\'t know. No, no, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Maybe I just wasn\'t paying attention. It was not a secret, but, um, I think, I think that. That it\'s been a couple of things that it it\'s been so long since the last one, that this is kind of a [00:42:00] reboot plus everything else that\'s going on in the community. And then 600 5650 tickets, um, that went on the market and got snapped up in 45 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it\'s, it\'s definitely, there\'s definitely more talk about. About the journey there and the importance and the importance of it. Um, and I don\'t know, that just seems good. Um, in some ways I, I wish, um, you know, I hope everyone can, well, I wish everyone could make it. Who wants to, I wasn\'t, I wasn\'t sure if I would, um, initially, but, um, Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people are saying, Hey, I need . Is there a way I can get, um, then, then that\'s in the, in the community there it\'s in like an a, it\'s a basic question of, um, can I get there? Can I be in, I wanna [00:43:00] be included in this, is that possible? Um, I just haven\'t seen that, that come up before. It\'s just a very private thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> well, I think that\'s. Well</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> it\'s upside. I mean, it\'s not awesome that people, people are gonna get shot out. I or it\'s to something. No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, of course not. It\'s awesome. That. The want is that high, like, oh yeah. Especially to network and meet everybody in the community. Cuz I mean meeting face to face, I think, eh, it is COVID, I\'m kind of hesitant on that and what monkey pop now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ugh. Oh yeah. But um, I think meeting will actually help people too. I think the internet gives you a lot. Gives not you. A lot of people louder, negative voices than they. Would usually have, yeah. I think a lot of, um, impersonal contact will, that\'ll be one thing that helps. So that that\'s an answer to your question earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that\'s gonna help. We\'re gonna have such a good time at work camp and like, everybody\'s gonna be like happy and they\'re gonna love each other and your face. [00:44:00] I, I just wanna see your face, but I think you be like, Hmm, we\'re gonna, what,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> but it\'s gonna be good. You\'re reminding me of my. Friend and cop neighbor when I lived in, in Milwaukee and he, uh, what, nothing go ahead, get a certain personality type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and he was actually very sensitive and, uh, well, red guy, but, uh, if I mentioned. Anything that sounded like that. He\'d say something about like, uh, yeah. And all the animals and people will hold hands and dance around the trees together or something like that was</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> his. And why can\'t we do that? It\'s California.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s Southern California. We can do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, it\'s always, it\'s always worth the effort of getting, getting people together and it does happen. It\'s a very individual thing and I, I hope there is. More of that. I\'ve only gotten it online when, when I take the time to, [00:45:00] you know, take some blows and talk to people, um, listen, don\'t react and, and try to understand where they\'re coming from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s just, yeah, it\'s, it\'s so much easier in person usually because, um, yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> just empathy. Oh yeah. We need a lot more. You do you want me to end by like singing some Julie Andrews? I have a really great voice. Oh, wow. I\'m joking. I\'m joking, Dan. No, you look too excited. Never mind you look so excited by me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> there\'s a, there\'s a karaoke request from Miriam Schwab. Um, in our, in post dad, slack. Yeah. People are lining up. And then out burger trips</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> and I do love karaoke. Okay. We\'ll we\'ll do it in California. We\'re</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> you are, you are a singer. Is that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> true? I am not. I lied. No. Okay. I, I have like a people tell me I have a singing voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know what that [00:46:00] means. I guess I kind of, I, I like, sometimes my sentences are like long, like a song, like I\'ll extend out a word that I, I don\'t know, but I cannot sing. I will sing though, especially at karaoke. So you\'ll see. All</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> right. I will definitely be watching. avoiding .

For this exercise he used WordPress&#8217; most recent default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two. His results are not identical to WordPress&#8217; new designs but are very close, and he was able to whip up the homepage in approximately 20 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Can I re-create the new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wordpress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#wordpress</a> home page in 20 mins? <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png\" alt=\"😅\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Here\'s my attempt on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/youtube?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#youtube</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/YeEDv914BF\">https://t.co/YeEDv914BF</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#gutenberg</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Vy7SB0HYYv\">pic.twitter.com/Vy7SB0HYYv</a></p>&mdash; Jamie Pootlepress &#8211; Gutenberg YouTuber and Builder (@pootlepress) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress/status/1559852989858332674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 17, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRrrYGpz9Qo\">video</a> (embedded below), Marsland walks through the creation of each section of the homepage. He is what one might describe as a power user with the block editor. He can quickly shuffle rows, columns, and groups around, adjusting padding and margins as necessary, and assign each section the corresponding color for the design. At this point, this is not something most average WordPress users could do, which is why the video had such a strong response from viewers. Marsland&#8217;s YouTube channel is centered around helping users <a href=\"https://www.pootlepress.com/wordpress-gutenberg-block-editor-guide/\">master building pages using Gutenberg</a> and stores with WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My conclusion was that it&#8217;s pretty easy to quickly get 95% of the design done, but it&#8217;s the final 5% that always takes the most time in my experience,&#8221; Marsland said. &#8220;My guess is that it was more about internal process that caused the delays, but without being involved its hard to say for sure. I really wanted to show that it wasn&#8217;t a Gutenberg issue with building the design (as Matt Mullenweg mentioned Wix and Squarespace and other WP pagebuilders.)&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex Shiels, an Automattic-sponsored contributor on the project, cited a few items unrelated to the block editor, that caused the delays, including working towards &#8220;reasonable standards for a11y, responsiveness, browser compatibility, SEO, and performance,&#8221; as well as collaborating with contributors across different continents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to Marsland&#8217;s attempt, WordPress developer Patrick Boehner commented on how the little details remain extremely important. &#8220;You can definitely tell what was design driven first vs designed in the editor,&#8221; Boehner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress/status/1559550927731937280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1559550927731937280%7Ctwgr%5Ec3a5e9c1f1cbbf40cff90acba6f4cdf2acfe138a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwptavern.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D137103action%3Dedit\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five years after Gutenberg&#8217;s debut in WordPress, theme developers are still challenged to bring designs to life that were not created with a block-first approach in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It remains today fundamentally difficult to impossible to take a traditionally mocked up page design and execute that design using blocks,&#8221; WordPress developer Jon Brown <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-launches-new-homepage-and-download-page-designs#comment-431942\">said</a>. &#8220;This is a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Sure, blocks are fine to &#8216;design a page in the browser&#8217; and accept what you get out of blocks, but blocks continue to lack the flexibility and controls needed to produce a responsive, accessible, pixel perfect layout based on a mock-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What used to take a day and a dozen lines of php and a dozen lines of css, now takes weeks of building custom blocks because the core blocks can’t easily be tweaked via hooks and lack the basic controls necessary.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg contributors are making strides by <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-13-8-introduces-fluid-typography-support-and-revamped-quote-block\">introducing fluid typography</a> and are <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/43241\">tracking a host of issues</a> related to improving design tooling consistency. In the meantime, theme developers are enduring the necessary growing pains as the block editor matures to accommodate those hoping to make their designs instantly responsive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’ve been building a full FSE theme from scratch and was surprised at how much of my design I was able to successfully replicate with the editor, theme.json and minimal-to-no custom CSS,&#8221; veteran theme developer Mike McAlister said. &#8220;Sure, it took a lot of tinkering, but I was impressed nonetheless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However, as Jon mentions, the second you need to adjust something for a smaller screen (or bigger screen if you dare to try mobile-first design in the editor), you hit a wall. It’s particularly apparent with margin, padding, and block gap, which have no responsive controls yet. You can see this adjusted via CSS in the new theme on .org.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responsiveness is one of the issues Shiels cited in why implementing the designs took more time than simply recreating the design in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However, there are hints of improvements coming for responsiveness,&#8221; McAlister commented. &#8220;Fluid typography and clamp() certainly have helped get typography in check, but there will always be circumstances where you need even finer control. Every other site builder has solved this, there’s no reason to think WordPress can’t or won’t. (I certainly hope so, as ~50-60% of traffic is coming from mobile devices these days!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of the best ways to push past these growing pains is to have as much dog-fooding as possible — using the editor and FSE to build for as many real-life scenarios as possible to uncover these blindspots.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marsland&#8217;s short exercise shows just how close you can get to recreating WordPress.org&#8217;s design in a short amount of time if you know your way around the block editor. He was successful in proving that the Gutenberg page building UI isn&#8217;t the holdup in reproducing designs created in other applications. Rather, it&#8217;s all the other related checklist items that developers generally have to resolve outside of the editor &#8211; including accessibility, responsiveness, and SEO considerations. The closer Gutenberg can get to reducing extra work related to responsiveness and accessibility, the more approachable it will be for regular users trying to produce the designs they dream up on their own.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 21:34:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"Post Status: Post Status Picks for the Week of August 15\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=106098\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-picks-for-the-week-of-august-15/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3061:\"<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-7-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Post Status Podcast Picks <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f399.png\" alt=\"🎙\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Shop Talk Show: Andrew Walpole and Alex Riviere from Traina talk about their WordPress experience but also how they want to go further with more tools.

Here’s a great walkthrough on how to do that from interaction designer and front-end developer <strong>Dana Byerly</strong>. They show us how to use WordPress with the static site generator&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eleventy</a>. I have to say, this was one of the easiest and most straightforward tutorials I’ve seen in a long time. Very well done! Also their site design is simply gorgeous and wonderfully accessible. Hat tip to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/palmiak_fp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Maciek Palmowski</a>&nbsp;for the find!<br /><br /><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/08/15/testing-and-feedback-for-the-fluid-typography-feature/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Testing and Feedback for the Fluid Typography Feature</a><br />The Make WordPress team is looking for feedback on this new feature in Gutenberg. In case you’re not familiar, fluid typography will scale to the screen’s available room so it always looks good. It’s important that theme developers take a look and see how it might work. For instance, in the comments, Post Status member <strong>Mark Root-Wiley</strong> mentions that using&nbsp;<code>clamp</code>&nbsp;might have some accessibility issues that need to be looked into further.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-38 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-7-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 id=\"h-cool-tool\">Cool Tool</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each week we’ll feature one cool tool that can help make your life easier as a WordPress builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-theme-palette-1-color has-text-color\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.programmingfonts.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><span>Programming Fonts</span></a></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This website helps you test drive monospaced fonts for programming.

The idea is to keep a happy, honest relationship between product development and its users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jon\'s been around the WordPress product entrance-exit block before with <strong>SearchWP</strong>. His thinking about OrganizeWP <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/jon-christopher-has-a-series-running/\">goes back a few years</a> too. (Actually it goes back a decade, with OrganizeWP\'s predecessor, <a href=\"https://github.com/jchristopher/hierarchy/\">Hierarchy</a>.) He\'s documented a lot of the planning and iteration on his site, so there\'s a lot to learn from if you\'re interested in <a href=\"https://jonchristopher.us/blog/rethinking-wordpress-product-pricing-models/\">a different business model</a> for WordPress products. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will it work? A lot of people with &#8220;subscription fatigue&#8221; seem to like the idea, what about the challenge of maintaining multiple major versions? That concern drives <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/organizewp-launches-with-old-school-software-pricing-model#comment-431950\">a skeptical take</a> from <strong>Carl Hancock</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-wordpress-admin-experience-still-a-blue-ocean\">The WordPress Admin Experience: Still a Blue Ocean</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at Jon\'s model, I wonder if OrganizeWP might be seen as a leading indicator for a couple of important trends and opportunities in the plugin business. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>OrganizeWP is a cool and needed product in an area that hasn\'t received a lot of love from plugin developers, let alone WordPress core: the wp-admin interface. WordPress core will catch up to the rest of the WordPress user experience on the other side of Gutenberg, but that\'s a few years away. So it surprises me how few plugin shops and developers have looked for opportunities in backend customization. (Only <strong><a href=\"https://publishpress.com\">PublishPress</a></strong> comes to mind as being really committed in this key area with their plugin suite.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress admin experience is something everyone wants to change when they\'re building sites for a team or larger group of users with unique content types and workflows. There\'s a large gap in what is available to that potentially high-end niche in the premium plugin marketplace. That\'s whose needs Jon is aiming to meet — freelancers, site builders, agencies. It\'s a good bet there\'s opportunity in those spaces, if you can go directly to the people there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Selling Outside WordPress.org: Don\'t Go Alone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Going directly to your target market touches the last and biggest item of note with OrganizeWP: it\'s not in the WordPress.org plugin repo. There was probably never any thought of putting it there. No freemium model. And at the same time, <strong>Lesley Sim</strong> has gotten attention for pulling <strong>Newsletter Glue</strong> <em>out</em> of the .org repo. Althought it\'s not exactly uncommon, the reasons why that choice gets made are worth deeper consideration for what it may say about the business and .org ecosystem today. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dropping Newsletter Glue\'s free version was a decision made some time ago, but the reasons behind it are really instructive for anyone starting out on the same path. Speaking to <strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> at the Tavern, Lesley <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/newsletter-glue-closes-free-plugin-on-wordpress-org\">noted</a> the challenges of the freemium model with a basic version in the plugin repo, especially if you don\'t have prior experience developing a product and marketing strategy for this approach. There\'s no onboarding for plugins owners where sharing current best practices (or simple checklists) with first time plugin owners helps them enter the WordPress.org marketplace. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Opportunities for Partnerships</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Lesley, the main upside of using WordPress.org for distribution is access to the &#8220;[b]iggest distribution channel in WP.&#8221; It\'s an &#8220;easy way for reviewers to check out the plugin for free&#8221; without contacting the plugin owner too. And finally the .org repo serves as a &#8220;[s]ource of credibility” from customer reviews.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without alternative centralized marketplaces, going outside .org requires plugin owners to create and maximize their own distribution channels, generate their own sources of social proof and provide an interface for customer support. Then there\'s the barrier of customer confusion and frustration with having to assemble all the parts of their site themselves. Meanwhile, SaaS and no code alternatives are more visible than ever. WordPress hosting platforms targeting eCommerce niches are making the &#8220;looking for an easy button&#8221; market increasingly competitive. There are mature, established models for building a market outside the .org plugin repo, but that may also be a disadvantage to newcomers entering the space.                                              </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get past all these hurdles, why not work together more intentionally? Partnerships, networks, and community building could be the key to success. If other plugin shops and owners see the value in working together and trying to help their customers reach their goals simply and quickly, they can amplify their marketing and distribution networks together rather than try to do it all alone. (See &#8220;<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/on-the-web-publishing-tool-race/\">On the Web Publishing Tool Race</a>.&#8221;) I\'d love to hear from anyone doing this or trying to do it, as a smaller, independent product owner today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Challenge: Lack of Market Data </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When a premium plugin leaves or never enters a centralized distribution channel, it goes off the radar. We have less data about it and the overall shape of this part of the plugin ecosystem. Assuming the number of plugins sold outside centralized marketplaces has only grown over time with WordPress, we know less about the ecosystem as time goes on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The .org repo which can be measured. So can the new and growing WordPress.com marketplace. Large ecosystem plugins like Elementor with their own marketplaces are highly visible. But outside of centralized distribution channels, we don\'t know what\'s happening or even have a map of that market with any depth or breadth. That\'s another disadvantage to product owners in that space. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are the centralized and decentralized products and markets all growing? At what rate relative to each other? However limited it may be, a key metric like active installs becomes an even bigger unknown when product owners set up shop outside the .org repository. That\'s data they could benefit from most directly. If that\'s something you\'re working on or thinking about deeply, I\'d love to chat. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-35 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2>Speaking of Market Data&#8230;</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In the WooCommerce ecosystem compared with WordPress, <strong>Ellipsis</strong> has some new data and analysis published that attempts to answer the question, &#8220;<a href=\"https://getellipsis.com/blog/whos-winning-on-the-woocommerce-marketplace/\">Who is winning in the WooCommerce marketplace</a>?&#8221; Their conclusions:<ul><li>WooCommerce has been a lot stronger than ​WordPress this year.</li><li>70% commission on sales makes the WooCommerce Marketplace a viable sales channel.</li><li>$85,498,900 in estimated revenue from the WooCommerce Marketplace.</li><li>They\'ve also got the top 5 highest grossing products in the Woo marketplace, all estimated as grossing over $2 million (USD).</li></ul></li></ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com\">Post Status</a> • <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://poststatus.com\">Post Status - The Community for WordPress Professionals</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 Aug 2022 15:30:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:126:\"WPTavern: Upcoming Free Workshops: Learn How to Convert Figma Files to a Block Theme and Take Block Patterns to the Next Level\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:136:\"https://wptavern.com/upcoming-free-workshops-learn-how-to-convert-figma-files-to-a-block-theme-and-take-block-patterns-to-the-next-level\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2931:\"<p>If you&#8217;re not following <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/learn-wordpress-online-workshops/\">Learn WordPress Online Workshops</a> on Meetup.com, you may be missing out on some high quality events.

The plugin was created to minimize customers abandoning their carts due to checkout complexity. It breaks the checkout experience into steps to make the process feel faster and simpler with a distraction-free design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flux Checkout 2.0.0 adds a new &#8220;Modern&#8221; theme  in addition to the plugin&#8217;s previous &#8220;Classic&#8221; theme that offers a more app-like checkout experience. Modern has a more minimalist black and grey design. Check out the <a href=\"https://demos.iconicwp.com/flux-checkout-for-woocommerce/checkout/#details\">live demo</a> to interact with the checkout preloaded with a few products.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The default Woo checkout is not optimized at all,&#8221; Iconic founder Jame Kemp said. &#8220;It presents you with the required fields, in a pretty unfriendly and overpowering way. If there are too many fields, the user is less likely to checkout.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comparing the default Woo checkout experience to Flux is a bit jarring, and it&#8217;s easy to see how customers may feel overwhelmed with the default. Fortunately, WooCommerce is extensible. The space could use more varied checkout plugins so store owners have more options to customize the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Default WooCommerce Checkout\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Flux reduces this friction by splitting the fields into steps and reducing the number of fields required to fill in,&#8221; Kemp said. &#8220;It also integrates an address auto complete to make filling in your address into a single field. We also cache the fields so if you accidentally refresh or navigate away, you don’t lose your info.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iconic<a href=\"https://iconicwp.com/blog/iconic-acquires-flux-checkout-woocommerce-checkout-plugin/\"> acquired Flux Checkout</a> in 2020, just as the pandemic was kicking off. Its chief competitor is <a href=\"https://www.checkoutwc.com/\">CheckoutWC</a>, which offers a similarly modern design, auto-populated fields, and additional templates at a higher price point. More than 3,900 WooCommerce sites are using CheckoutWC, but Kemp says Flux Checkout &#8220;wins on ease of use and simplified checkout.&#8221; In a few months, the company plans to release FluxPay, which will make it possible to &#8220;buy now&#8221; from product pages and will add other time-saving features for checking out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kemp reports Iconic&#8217;s WooCommerce products are active on more than 21,000 sites. The company is part of StellarWP and the Iconic team includes four developers, 2-3 support agents, a content writer, and a designer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our most popular product is WooThumbs, but Flux, Delivery Slots, <a href=\"https://orderable.com/\">Orderable</a>, Attribute Swatches, and our All Access bundle are the most popular/profitable,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kemp first launched WooThumbs on CodeCanyon in 2011. The Iconic brand was formed in 2018 as a means to consolidate all of his  WooCommerce offerings and move off of CodeCanyon to become an independent brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re fortunate enough to have been in the WooCommerce space for many years and have a well-established customer base and set of products,&#8221; Kemp said. &#8220;Right now, and particularly throughout the pandemic, the Woo space has been booming. We&#8217;ve consistently seen growth as a WooCommerce product company. It is becoming a very competitive space and it&#8217;s important to stay on top of the features you&#8217;re offering.

They’ve been optimising websites for many years and make significant contributions to the WordPress project, committing to Core, sponsoring events and many other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sat down with them both at WordCamp Europe and we talked about some of the recent changes that have taken place within the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having worked hard to build and maintain their company&#8217;s reputation, they decided that it was time to steer the business in a new direction by selling it to <a href=\"https://newfold.com/\">Newfold Digital</a>. We get into the reasons for this acquisition and the subsequent reshuffling of the management of the company. What were the details of that agreement, why did they join forces with Newfold Digital in particular, and how has the acquisition gone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also talk about their longstanding commitment to contributing back to the WordPress project. Why have they done this and what benefits have they seen from this approach?

Head over to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox. And use the contact form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Marieke Van De Rakt &amp; Taco Verdonschot. And they&#8217;re both from Yoast SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s quite likely that you&#8217;ve heard of Yoast SEO, but in case you have not, it&#8217;s a very popular WordPress SEO plugin installed over 5 million times. They&#8217;ve been optimizing websites for many years and make significant contributions to the WordPress project, committing to Core, sponsoring events and many other things. I sat down with them both at WordCamp Europe, and we talked about some of the recent changes that have taken place within the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having worked hard to build and maintain their company&#8217;s reputation, they decided that it was time to steer the business in a new direction by selling it to Newfold Digital. We get into the reasons for this acquisition and the subsequent reshuffling of the management of the company. What were the details of that agreement? Why did they join forces with Newfold Digital in particular? And how has the acquisition gone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also talk about their long standing commitment to contributing back to the WordPress project. Why have they done this? And what benefits have they seen from this approach? Why do they bring so many of their team to WordCamps?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Yost is well-known in the WordPress space they recently brought their product into an entirely new market, Shopify. This has led them to create a SaaS version of their SEO solution and has brought them into contact with a completely new market. How has this move gone? And does it mean they&#8217;re moving away from WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically when we record the podcast there&#8217;s not a lot of background noise, but that&#8217;s not always the case with these WordCamp Europe interviews. We were competing against crowds and the air conditioning. And whilst the podcasts are more than listable.

And so without further delay, I bring you. Marieke Van De Rakt &amp; Taco Verdonschot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Marieke van de Rakt and Taco, go on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:48] Taco Verdonschot: Verdonschot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:49] Nathan Wrigley: I tried that many, many times in the past. How are you both doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:53] Taco Verdonschot: All good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:53] Marieke van de Rakt: Yeah. Great, great, great being back at an in-person event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:57] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. What are your thoughts about that. Genuinely, what are your thoughts about being back in in-person events? Because I know the Pavlovian response is, it&#8217;s great to be back. I think that, but is there any bit of you, which is mmm?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:08] Marieke van de Rakt: I have a hard time recognizing people because it&#8217;s been two years. I see now that everybody has that problem, so it&#8217;s like, I know you I&#8217;ve danced with you. I don&#8217;t know who you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:20] Taco Verdonschot: And especially when people are masked. You just see the eyes and, and if they like gained a lot of weight or became a bit grayer like me. Or lost a lot of weight, there&#8217;s definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] Marieke van de Rakt: It&#8217;s harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] Taco Verdonschot: It&#8217;s a change and with a mask on it&#8217;s a lot harder to recognize people. So I&#8217;m really happy with the badges that have the names on both sides. Which means that it will at least always give a clue and not be turned the wrong way like sometimes happens at WordCamps. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:50] Marieke van de Rakt: So I think it&#8217;s good being back, but it&#8217;s also, it&#8217;s different. It&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s been a while seeing people in such a way. We&#8217;ve talked online, but that&#8217;s really different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:01] Nathan Wrigley: For me what&#8217;s strange, and I know this is gonna sound ridiculous, is that you are not this big and I&#8217;m making a gesture about six inches high, but also you both have entire bodies. It&#8217;s not just from the sort of waist up. We are on contributor today, so basically very little has happened so far. But what are your expectations of this event? What does Yoast bring when it comes to an event like this? What are you hoping to do? Do you have like a battle plan? Do you just bring the whole team and just see how it goes? I know you&#8217;ve got sponsorships and lots of things like that. So tell us what your agenda is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:32] Taco Verdonschot: We&#8217;re sponsoring, as you said, and we brought a nice booth. There will be activities, and of course there will be stroopwafels, loads of them. So make sure that if you&#8217;re here you don&#8217;t miss out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:43] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m gonna pause you there because I don&#8217;t know what that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:46] Marieke van de Rakt: You don&#8217;t know what stroopwafels are?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:49] Nathan Wrigley: No</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:50] Marieke van de Rakt:You can have like a lot of them because we don&#8217;t bring them back anymore. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:52] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah. So stroopwafels are cookies, are waffles with sort of a caramel in between. And they are delicious. That&#8217;s that just says it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] Nathan Wrigley: In the brief time that I&#8217;ve been around the auditorium, you win in terms of t-shirt density.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:11] Marieke van de Rakt: I saw the same thing. I think a lot of companies don&#8217;t give their employees, t-shirts to wear or different ones. We also, because I have a new one actually Taco but it&#8217;s exactly the same color, so it matches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:23] Nathan Wrigley: And there&#8217;s nobody with the purple, so it genuinely stands out. But it also means, I think, that you bring a big team. Which also tells me that you&#8217;ve got a big team. 140, something like that? And I was looking earlier today at the stats for contributions in the version 6.0 of WordPress. Automattic, always the big circle and then there&#8217;s companies, which are vying for second, third. And it always seems like Yoast is number two by a long way. Is that a big part of the Yoast system? Do you encourage your team to contribute and all of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:58] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah, so we have a Core team. That&#8217;s four people working full time on WordPress Core. And that&#8217;s a big part. We also host internal contributor days. Well, actually we&#8217;ve opened them up to the community. So everyone can join remotely, or at the office nowadays. One of the reasons why you&#8217;re seeing so many of the purple shirts today is because our entire team is signed up for contributor day, and everyone is contributing to WordPress today. So probably you&#8217;ll see more brands and, and more colors tomorrow, but bringing people to contributor day is definitely a part of who we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:35] Marieke van de Rakt: It&#8217;s what got us started. So we are really invested in making WordPress better, because that&#8217;s just what we&#8217;ve been doing from even before Yoast was a company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:44] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s been an exceptional commitment though. It&#8217;s not an ordinary commitment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:48] Marieke van de Rakt: I think so, too. So I, I&#8217;m really glad you&#8217;re saying that. We have an exceptional commitment to making that better. And I think more companies should follow that lead because that way we can really make it better together. So we can bitch with each other about what should be better, or we can just sit down and make sure the work gets done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:08] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. It&#8217;s been a busy couple of years for Yoast. Obviously there&#8217;s been the pandemic. Presumably you had to figure out what the office looked like or didn&#8217;t look like and what zoom calls you were gonna foist on people and so on and so forth. You mentioned that you&#8217;re back to the office a bit. But apart from all of that, there&#8217;s been quite a lot of personnel change, especially recently. Joost as in Joost, the man not the product, has changed roles. You&#8217;ve changed roles. Taco has got a new role. I saw a photo the other day with several people who&#8217;ve got new roles. Tell us a little bit about that. What brought that about, and then maybe we&#8217;ll get into the acquisition piece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:42] Marieke van de Rakt: Yeah. Well, because that was the trigger. I think about a year before we had the acquisition, we started the process. I already knew that I wouldn&#8217;t want to be the CEO of the company anymore. I think that role is really, it&#8217;s a really heavy one, and it&#8217;s also a very public one, and it&#8217;s just been tough. And COVID was tough. So, when we decided to sell, I already knew that I wouldn&#8217;t want to be the CEO of the company anymore, but I still wanted to work there. But go back to a role I had before I was the CEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think the acquisition got us all into that change process. So the first thing was that I announced that I wasn&#8217;t going to be the CEO. Now, Joost is an advisor. Omar left. Our CTO, well, I just texted him that I really miss him. But I also understand we&#8217;ve been doing this for quite some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joost himself got a bit bored, not with WordPress though, but with SEO, and wants to do other things as well. And is currently experienced a lot of FOMO he said. But he&#8217;ll be here tomorrow. So he&#8217;ll be on Friday. He said to me, oh, you&#8217;re all contributing and I&#8217;m just writing a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, those things changed, and I&#8217;m really excited because we, um, we now have room for new people to grow because you could see Yoast as this big old oak, and that&#8217;s good and that&#8217;s solid. But it also takes away the sun for other trees to grow. So now it&#8217;s the time for at least within Yoast, to have new talent and new leadership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:17] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. Okay, so just sticking to the top tier management, just run us through the changes. Who&#8217;s now in? Who&#8217;s got those key top tier jobs?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:25] Taco Verdonschot: So I think that list should always start with Thijs, our CEO. He took over that role from Marieke, I think last year, October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:34] Marieke van de Rakt: Somewhere like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:35] Taco Verdonschot: Around that time, and then as of April this year we had the bigger change, that we introduced a seven people leadership team. So that&#8217;s obviously Marieke as head of strategy. That&#8217;s Chaya as chief operations officer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:51] Marieke van de Rakt: She was already also in the old board. She came in COVID time. So this is her first WordCamp. She was with us for quite some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:58] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah, and then there&#8217;s four new names, and that&#8217;s Irene on the R and D side. Inge on the marketing side. Herre for all the technical stuff. And me as a head of relations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:12] Marieke van de Rakt: And those four have been working with us for more than five years. All of them. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:16] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah. All of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:17] Nathan Wrigley: So if we rewind the clock about five years, it feels like nobody was being acquired in WordPress. It was all very quiet. And then about four years ago it began. And then two years ago it was really, there was a daily news cycle of somebody&#8217;s been bought in the WordPress space. And then you came in and I must admit I follow the WordPress news pretty closely. I didn&#8217;t see that one coming. Tell us how that came about. How far do we need to go back before the dates that it was announced, when all the negotiations started, and why you mentioned that Yoast himself was getting a bit bored. But for other reasons, I&#8217;m sure as well, why did that process begin? And how long was that process?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:54] Marieke van de Rakt: So we talked to parties before just because you get a lot of questions. So it&#8217;s not that we never thought about a possible acquisition or funding before. But we&#8217;re totally bootstraped, and I think Christmas 2020, so the first COVID Christmas, that was when Joost and I decided we should sell or get major funding. And the major reason was that COVID got us scared. We were doing great but it was so much work. We sell in dollars, so we make money in dollars, but all of our costs are in euros. And that makes you very vulnerable for the exchange rate of the dollar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t control. And with a hundred, I don&#8217;t know 125 people on your payroll, the responsibility was weighing heavily on both of us, and that&#8217;s just something that we didn&#8217;t want to do anymore. So then we hired, we hired a banker actually. Someone who helps you to sell your company. And we&#8217;ve talked to a lot of, well, the usual suspects. Then decided eventually to sell to Newfold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:03] Nathan Wrigley: So what was it about the offer that they presented, which said, okay, that&#8217;s it, the green light over there. Was there something in particular? Were there any red lines that you presented to them? Right, this cannot happen, if we&#8217;re gonna sell to anybody. Yeah, just that kind of idea. What were the things that gave the green light to them and not to others?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:19] Marieke van de Rakt: So when we were selling, we thought about three things. We thought about ourselves. What&#8217;s good for us. And then we thought about what&#8217;s good for Yoast the company, and what&#8217;s good for WordPress. So we wouldn&#8217;t sell to a company that would just do things that would be bad for WordPress. And we won&#8217;t sell to a company that would say you have fire half of your staff or something like that. So would be good for our employees. It would be a good fit for WordPress. And I think the offer of Newfold, Newfold wanted to buy us because of our commitments in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they were impressed with our WordPress Core team. They wanted to do more in WordPress and, so them inquiring us was part of their mission to show we love WordPress, which is the best reason to buy us, I think. And I thought their leadership was really diverse. And I&#8217;ve talked to a lot of boards and they&#8217;re mostly male and white and a bit gray, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with people that are male and white and gray. But it&#8217;s nice to see some diversity in that. Well Newfold Digital is led by a woman. I&#8217;m really impressed by her. So that was at least, for me personally, a big reason to choose for them as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:33] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s a name which doesn&#8217;t roll off the tongue. What I mean by that is, you know, everybody&#8217;s heard of Yoast, everybody&#8217;s heard of Automattic, but maybe not so much Newfold Digital. Can you just tell the listeners which bits of Newfold Digital may we have heard of before? Because I know they&#8217;re a company which are behind other companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:48] Marieke van de Rakt: They only exist for like a year and a half now and they&#8217;ve been combined. So the Endurance group, which Blue Host is the biggest brand. And then you have the web dot com side, but that&#8217;s not a WordPress side. And those two companies were combined into Newfold Digital, and they only existed like a half year and then they acquired Yoast. So it&#8217;s a really new brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:09] Nathan Wrigley: In terms of job stability and all of those kind of things, you mentioned that that was an important part. How&#8217;s that going,? Have roles changed? Has the company still got the same focus that it had a year ago? Well, let&#8217;s not say a year, six months ago, or have you noticed any changes and I&#8217;m firing this one at Taco.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:27] Taco Verdonschot: So yes, there have been changes due to what we just described in, in changing in leadership, but in terms of direction of the company, it&#8217;s not that Newfold comes in and says, Hey, you need to go left or you need to go right. For exactly what Marieke just told, is they bought us for what we do and who we are. That&#8217;s still true today. So they kept their word from that whole process and are still supporting us in being Yoast and offering SEO for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have there been changes in the company in the last six months? Yes, we, we are slowly changing. The workforce landscape is changing, and we&#8217;re changing with it. But nothing forced by the acquisition. This would&#8217;ve happened anyway if we weren&#8217;t sold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:14] Marieke van de Rakt: Ah, and nobody left after the acquisition for a few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:17] Taco Verdonschot: No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:18] Marieke van de Rakt: So that wasn&#8217;t related to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:20] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:20] Marieke van de Rakt: I think the biggest change was just that the office is opened up again. And so everything&#8217;s different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:26] Nathan Wrigley: In terms of how the company can behave, the inflow of money I presume, you mentioned payroll and how concerning that was. Does that kind of thing evaporate a little bit more? Do you need to worry it a little bit less about payroll, because that&#8217;s now worried about somewhere further up the food chain?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:42] Marieke van de Rakt: For me that&#8217;s changed dramatically. So I used to look at the sales every day. I think Joost would look at it every hour, and see if it&#8217;s all going well and that changed, and that gave us a lot of… I was talking to Joshua Strebel, who of course also sold and to like, taking a coat off, that&#8217;s what it is. It&#8217;s taking a coat off, and I still feel a huge responsibility of getting that company with new leadership into a stable, good new path, but it&#8217;s different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:11] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah. The funny thing is for me, it&#8217;s quite the opposite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:14] Marieke van de Rakt: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:14] Taco Verdonschot: Because before, Marieke and the rest of the board would take away all those financial concerns from even the highest management level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:25] Marieke van de Rakt: That wasn&#8217;t the best idea though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:26] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:26] Marieke van de Rakt: We did that. We never told anybody about our financial stress. We were doing great, but we were experiencing, oh, we have to grow, and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:34] Taco Verdonschot: That was really something that was kept away, and now with, my new role, I&#8217;m suddenly seeing all the numbers and seeing what the numbers mean and how they influence decisions that we&#8217;re making in the company and vice versa, how decisions are influencing our, our revenue stream or our cost. And that&#8217;s a whole new world. So, for me, I&#8217;m looking more at numbers and for you, it&#8217;s obviously with less worry than before. Yeah, we, we found common ground now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:05] Nathan Wrigley: Two years ago, or whenever it was 2019, if we&#8217;d have had this same interview, we would&#8217;ve been talking about Yoast SEO and nothing more. But now we can talk about Shopify. That&#8217;s a big change. A giant of a platform. Just give us the theory behind why Shopify? Why not, I don&#8217;t know something else like Drupal, or some other thing like Squarespace? Is that product receiving the same care and attention, shall we say as the WordPress side? Do you have any plans to go into other CMSs, maybe SaaS products, like I said, Wix and Squarespace and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to release any of that valuable information if you don&#8217;t want to of course. But tell us about the Shopify thing first. Whoever wants to take that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:43] Marieke van de Rakt: We have a TYPO3 extension, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:45] Taco Verdonschot: Yes and Neos as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:47] Marieke van de Rakt: So we, we had some before, but we, as a pact internally would say that we wouldn&#8217;t do any non open source CMSs, but still we are doing Shopify. So we made the decision, partly because we wanted to be less dependent on WordPress, because although we love WordPress, it&#8217;s very scary if you bet all your money on one thing. So it could be a wise business decision to go into Shopify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They asked us to come. So Shopify wanted to improve their SEO so they worked together with us. They asked us can you build Yoast SEO for Shopify? So that was a big reason, and their core values are pretty aligned with us. So that was the thing. Okay, we&#8217;re going to let go of the open source part because they&#8217;re really for the small businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s either Amazon because that&#8217;s how people sell, but at least on Shopify, you have your own website, your own store, and that&#8217;s really important. So that&#8217;s why I think why we decided Shopify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:44] Taco Verdonschot: And I think it&#8217;s the close source system or SaaS that comes closest to the open source mindset, because it really supports the small businesses, and you can get started super easily on Shopify and anyone and everyone can start a shop. And that is different for a lot of other systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:06] Marieke van de Rakt: And it&#8217;s growing like crazy. So it&#8217;s also a really good business opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:10] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah I have no insight into how that&#8217;s going. So it is growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] Marieke van de Rakt: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:16] Nathan Wrigley: Are you growing with it? Is it taking you along for the ride? Basically, has it been a good move?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:18] Marieke van de Rakt: Well, We&#8217;ve built the thing ourselves, which is a lot of work because Shopify isn&#8217;t WordPress. we&#8217;ve launched it. We had a successful launch, but we&#8217;re not as well known in the Shopify world yet. So we&#8217;re growing gradually and that sounds like bad news, but I love that because that&#8217;s what we want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s so much fun. We&#8217;re celebrating every five star review we get. So we have a dedicated Shopify team and they&#8217;re so excited to get people to like our product, but Shopify just works a little differently and you can&#8217;t paste your WordPress product over it. So we&#8217;re tweaking it and it gets better every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:55] Taco Verdonschot: Every single day. So the good thing about our Shopify app is that it fully is a SaaS which means that were not bound to releases that people then have to install. And if we decide to push something, it&#8217;s live right now. That&#8217;s a very big difference compared to WordPress, where you&#8217;re relying on people to install your updates and to actually keep their site up to date, et cetera. So it&#8217;s a really different way of developing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:25] Marieke van de Rakt: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:26] Nathan Wrigley: Marika. You&#8217;ve got a, I was gonna say a talk, but it&#8217;s not. You&#8217;ve got a panel. Just tell us what this panel&#8217;s about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:31] Marieke van de Rakt: This panel is about acquisitions and WordPress. I&#8217;m just going to sit there and if they ask me a question then they&#8217;ll answer. I think a lot of people want to know, the ins and outs of what happens and what does this mean for WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:43] Nathan Wrigley: SEO in general. What is going on in the future? I&#8217;ve been seeing quite a lot coming out of the Google verse. Awful lot of people talking about things like AI content and whether or not that&#8217;s gonna be squashed. What do we need to be mindful of in the next 12 months in terms of SEO?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:58] Marieke van de Rakt: I think the main thing Google does is wanting to present the best result to the user. So if you&#8217;re stable in SEO and just create good content, AI or not AI because it just has to be good. And there are really good AI tools out there, but it should be something your reader will want to read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not just something you, nobody wants to read. That&#8217;s not serving anyone. That&#8217;s the thing you need to do. But at the same time on the technical side, we are really looking at what Google is doing. So then you need to just install Yoast SEO, because we&#8217;ll make sure to get the latest technical stuff in there. So the way Google crawls and stuff, we&#8217;re really mindful of that. But I think a normal user wouldn&#8217;t be able to adapt that in a website settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:42] Nathan Wrigley: I have this concern that we&#8217;re gonna be creating content with AI, which is then in turn, the sole purpose of that is to be consumed by Google&#8217;s AI. And it&#8217;s like this cyclical effect where…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:55] Marieke van de Rakt: But then you&#8217;re doing it wrong way because you should always create content for a user. Yeah. And I am a writer. So I am not particularly fan of AI created content, but I have to be honest, sometimes it&#8217;s pretty good. But it should be original content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you should at least insert enough information in your AI that it&#8217;s an original thought, because an artificial intelligence can never come up with something new. It&#8217;s always something that&#8217;s already out there. So make sure you write something that people want to read. That&#8217;s the only advice that I can give you. Maybe Google won&#8217;t be the only search engine out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are all kinds of rumors that Apple is doing stuff and rolling out his own search engine. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s true, but that&#8217;s something that could happen as well. Google doesn&#8217;t have to be the only, Yoast SEO isn&#8217;t the only SEO plugin. Google doesn&#8217;t have to necessarily be the only search engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:50] Nathan Wrigley: Is that what you focus most of your energy though, because presumably if there is an Apple SEO search page, your work then sort of doubles because you&#8217;ve got to try and figure out their algorithm as well as the Google algorithm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:02] Marieke van de Rakt: They&#8217;re probably doing the same thing. It&#8217;s the same with Bing and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:05] Taco Verdonschot: Yeah, in the end they have the same goal. They want to answer a user&#8217;s question. So in order to do that, you need that good content. If you want to rank first, you need to be the best result. That&#8217;s basically it. Regardless of which search engine you use to find that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:23] Marieke van de Rakt: Wouldn&#8217;t it be fun though? I would get excited again with SEO, if there would be a different kind. Maybe a privacy more minded kind, because that would be awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] Nathan Wrigley: Have you heard of a search engine called Kagi? K A G I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:36] Marieke van de Rakt: I haven&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:38] Nathan Wrigley: Do you remember ManageWP? It is created by him. It&#8217;s in beta only at the moment. And it&#8217;s gonna be a paid for search engine and you&#8217;ll pay them a hundred dollars a year, something along those lines, for no tracking. So the gamble is that you pay. It&#8217;s actually really interesting. K A G I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So what are you gonna do over the next couple of days, the pair of you? What are you hoping to get out of this specific event? Who are you gonna go and see? What things are you excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:03] Taco Verdonschot: So we made a great start yesterday evening. There was a party by Pagely, and it was on a, on a boat, with so many people and a lot of familiar faces that we hadn&#8217;t seen in three years. And that&#8217;s going to continue because over the course of this event, we&#8217;ll see our old friends and meet a lot of new friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:23] Marieke van de Rakt: Interesting conversations with possible partners. It&#8217;s exciting to meet our Bluehost new colleagues and our Yith colleagues who are all part of the Newfold family, so that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m looking forward to as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I am looking forward to talking to actual customers because I use WordCamps to talk to customers and ask them why they like our product and what they dislike. And, well, I haven&#8217;t done that for ages, so only with people in our local community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:51] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;ve got a feeling I know what the answer to this question is. In 2023 WordCamp Europe, wherever that may be, will you be back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:57] Taco Verdonschot: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:58] Marieke van de Rakt: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:59] Nathan Wrigley: Taco, Marieke, thanks for talking to me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:01] Taco Verdonschot: Thank you so much for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:03] Marieke van de Rakt: Thank you.</p>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Designers Explore Adding Configuration Options to Block Editor Onboarding Modal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137017\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-designers-explore-adding-configuration-options-to-block-editor-onboarding-modal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3615:\"<p>Gutenberg designers are considering replacing the current welcome guide modal with a new onboarding screen that prompts users to configure some of the editor&#8217;s many individual preference settings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The existing welcome setup was designed during the earlier days of the block editor when many WordPress users were experiencing it for the first time. It briefly introduces users to the concept of blocks and invites them to customize them. The editor has matured since this welcome guide was created and it could use an update.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />The existing welcome guide\n\n\n\n<p>The editor is now loaded with more settings for personalizing the content creation experience, such as document toolbar placement and accessibility features, that users may not ever discover on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To create an editing experience that feels intuitive, folks will often need to tailor these settings based on their individual preferences and needs,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored designer James Koster said in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/04/design-exploration-encourage-editor-configuration-during-on-boarding/\">a post on the Make Design blog</a>. &#8220;There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Instead of relying on people to find these settings on their own (admittedly they’re a little scattered, but that’s another issue), it might be good to surface them during onboarding. Consequently, users can set up a comfy editing experience straight-away.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koster is proposing users configure these settings when getting started with the editor for the first time. He shared a video demonstrating how that might look. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The modal is much bigger than the existing welcome guide. It is also more interactive. When users mouse over the options in the left side, it shows a preview in the right side of the modal. The following user preferences are included in Koster&#8217;s prototype:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>document toolbar display</li><li> the block toolbar</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42399\">text formatting tools</a></li><li>accessibility options for toolbar button display, editor styles, and block keyboard navigation</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The first screen of the modal allows users to skip the setup and go straight to writing. This will be useful for those who do not care to configure any user preferences or those who are in a hurry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koster posted the proposal a couple weeks ago, asking whether it is a good idea in the first place, but hasn&#8217;t received much critical feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visually, the larger modal is an improvement on the existing welcome guide, but will it be overwhelming to users who are brand new to the block editor? Will it even make sense to them? A certain level of familiarity with the block editor is required to have any context for the editor customization options. An onboarding wizard with a lot of new terms could take a psychological toll on new users. It&#8217;s a lot to take in before getting started in the editor. Are these preferences so important that they need to be the first thing users see when they open the editor? Something like this will need some real user testing before it makes its way to millions of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koster and the Gutenberg design contributors are still looking for feedback on the project.

&nbsp;Automattic-sponsored WordPress marketing team contributor Nicholas Garofalo <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/08/a-new-wordpress-org-homepage-and-download-page/\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The new download page greets visitors with a new layout that makes getting started with WordPress even easier by presenting both the download and hosting options right at the top.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Download page now clearly offers two paths at the top &#8211; buttons for downloading and installing WordPress, and hosting recommendations for setting  it up through a hosting provider. It also includes help getting started with resources linked further down the page WordPress courses, developer resources, support, and user forums.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Although the designs have received overwhelmingly positive feedback, their journey to development was not without a few bumps in the road. When the Meta team published an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2022/08/01/developing-the-redesigned-home-and-download-pages/\">update</a> about taking the designs into development, less than three weeks from the design kickoff, Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s criticism of the pace of the project drew the ire of some community members who were offended by the interaction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is not a good use of time, nor does it further the actual goals of a new homepage or download page, and we have better places to spend our development time,&#8221; Mullenweg said in response to the plans to create a block theme for the new designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It is important to note that the person he is responding to here is working in capacity as a volunteer, sponsored (employed) by Automattic.

Mullenweg contended that turning Figma designs into a theme should have taken far less time to launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;On the &#8216;hours not weeks&#8217; to implement — it’s such a basic layout, it’s hard to imagine it taking a single person more than a day on Squarespace, Wix, Webflow, or one of the WP page builders,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So, if we’re just doing a prettier version of the same thing, make those changes in place with the existing code approach quickly and move on to something higher value. If you are trying to further WP itself, you need a fundamentally different approach.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some interpreted these comments as a referendum on the block editor&#8217;s usability. The development plan Shiels outlined included the creation of custom blocks in order to launch an MVP of the new theme. This called into question whether the block editor is delivering on its &#8220;dream it, build it&#8221; promises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The&nbsp;core&nbsp;team has to&nbsp;edit the core blocks&nbsp;for such&nbsp;a simple layout&nbsp;– after 2+ years, what should ordinary users/developers expect?&#8221; WordPress developer Aleksandar Perisic commented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Dog-fooding is needed just as much as code-focused contributions right now,&#8221; WP Engine software engineer Mike McAlister <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemcalister/status/1557850870338945025\">said</a>. &#8220;One informs the other. I’ve been knee deep in FSE for months and honestly it doesn’t feel like anyone has tried to make a REAL site with this.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to giving WordPress.org a fresh coat of paint, the project has sparked a larger conversation about how challenging it still is to build out simple designs with the block editor, even for the people who make WordPress. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 01:29:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WPTavern: Newsletter Glue Closes Free Plugin on WordPress.org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=136969\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wptavern.com/newsletter-glue-closes-free-plugin-on-wordpress-org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4649:\"<p>The creators of <a href=\"https://newsletterglue.com/\">Newsletter Glue</a> have <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/newsletter-glue/\">removed their free plugin from WordPress.org </a>in favor of focusing on the commercial version. The plugin streamlines the publishing workflow for newsletter authors who also publish to their WordPress sites. It includes blocks and patterns for email templates and subscriber forms. Five months ago the plugin&#8217;s authors warned users that they would be closing the free version and would no longer be updating it as of May 1, but the process of removing it was delayed until today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-founder Lesley Sim <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lesley_pizza/status/1559092795004317696\">announced</a> the plugin&#8217;s closure on Twitter and shared a few valuable lessons for WordPress product businesses looking to use WordPress.org as a their primary distribution channel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We made a bunch of noob mistakes in the way we set up free vs paid,&#8221; Sim said. &#8220;Which made the customer upgrade flow kind of weird. I think it could&#8217;ve worked. We just didn&#8217;t set it up right, and it just doesn&#8217;t make sense to fix it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of closure, the free Newsletter Glue plugin had approximately 200 active installations, which seems low for a growing commercial plugin. This is because the free version got uninstalled when a user upgraded to pro, so it was never a good representation of how many people were using the product. Sim said Newsletter Glue wasn&#8217;t growing the free user base and &#8220;it was just sitting there like a dead tree stump.&#8221; The company had not updated it in over a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We stupidly set it such that when a user upgrades, they install the pro version and the free version automatically uninstalls,&#8221; Sim said. &#8220;So we lost free active users as a &#8216;reward&#8217; for new conversions.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This architectural choice meant that WordPress.org wasn&#8217;t bringing the product a significant flow of traffic and prospective upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A year ago, we simply didn&#8217;t have enough features to make good decisions on what to put in the free versus pro,&#8221; Sim said. &#8220;So we went from having all our integrations on the free plugin to gating some integrations instead. I think this was a poor decision and led to our install count instantly stagnating. This could have been reversed, so I don&#8217;t think this was a key reason. But it was an instigating reason to begin considering removing the plugin from the repo since it was no longer bringing us traffic and installs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite not finding WordPress.org a good source of traffic for the product, Sim said the decision to close was not easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Here are some things we lost out on:&#8221; Sim said. &#8220;1) Biggest distribution channel in WP. 2) Easy way for reviewers to check out the plugin for free without having to contact me. 3) Source of credibility (reviews).&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Current users can still use the free plugin but it will not be getting updates anymore. In lieu of a free plugin, Newsletter Glue is offering a test drive option where users can try it on a demo site before purchasing. The company has taken a unique path to becoming a commercial plugin that is fully independently distributed.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I hate the free to paid user experience on the WP directory with a passion,&#8221; Sim said. &#8220;We had a full standalone pro plugin so the upgrade flow was really clunky. We&#8217;d get users using the free version emailing us saying, &#8216;I&#8217;ve just upgraded, but I don&#8217;t see any pro features on my site. What&#8217;s wrong?&#8217; I also had some wonderful customers who would upgrade then continue using the free version for over a year, not even realizing they were on the free version.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By focusing focusing exclusively on promoting the commercial product, the Newsletter Glue team is now free of the burden of supporting customers transitioning from the free version. The trade-off is missing out on exposure on WordPress.org. It&#8217;s an approach that works for the company at this stage but may not be suitable to other new products without strong marketing in place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Unless you already have experience marketing a plugin from scratch AND you have a good go to market plan, I think the default choice should be to be on the [WordPress] repo,&#8221; Sim said. &#8220;Just make sure you set up the commercial part of your plugin correctly so that it makes sense.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 15 Aug 2022 20:19:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WordPress.org blog: A New WordPress.org Homepage and Download Page\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13321\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/08/a-new-wordpress-org-homepage-and-download-page/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7724:\"<p>The WordPress experience has significantly evolved in the past few years.

It&#8217;s a utility plugin that Christopher has had on his mind since before he released its predecessor, the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/hierarchy-plugin-enhances-wordpress-as-a-cms\">Hierarchy</a> plugin, eight years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress Admin felt really disjointed once Custom Post Types were a new thing (this is how long ago we&#8217;re talking) because there were top level content &#8216;buckets&#8217; mixed and matched with Plugins and Settings and everything else,&#8221; Christopher said. &#8220;Then products started using the Admin Menu as a form of advertising to an extent, putting top level Menu items in place when they absolutely aren&#8217;t necessary, and the problem just got worse and worse.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christopher aimed to tackle this same problem with OrganizeWP but redesigned the UI and rebuilt it with JavaScript to accommodate new features like groups and drag and drop. The new product is now out of beta and is catching some attention due to its unusual <a href=\"https://organizewp.com/checkout/\">pricing</a> model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For $29.00, users get access to updates and support for Version 2. OrganizeWP is selling licenses for the current major version with no subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a post titled <a href=\"https://jonchristopher.us/blog/rethinking-wordpress-product-pricing-models/\">Rethinking WordPress Product Pricing Models</a>, Christopher highlights the drawbacks of using the subscription model, which is used widely in the WordPress ecosystem for software products that users host on their own websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Support, I would argue, is&nbsp;<em>by far</em>&nbsp;the reason so many WordPress products have adopted a subscription-based pricing model,&#8221; Christopher said. &#8220;The support burden for products in the WordPress space is&nbsp;<strong>hugely significant</strong>. It goes hand-in-hand with the self-sufficiency that comes with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We run into problems when the platform relies on self-sufficiency but the customer is not self-sufficient.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Since OrganizeWP is an admin-facing tool with no frontend output, Christopher decided it was &#8220;a prime candidate for a more old school software pricing model in that licenses will be sold for each major version, with no automatic expiration.&#8221; He plans to support version 2 of OrganizeWP indefinitely in terms of compatibility with WordPress and bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With heavily committing to major versions being the big planning milestones, updates will involve (primarily) bug fixes when applicable as opposed to adding new features,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Each major version will be feature frozen, so the updates will look a bit different when compared to most WordPress products today.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christopher identified subscription fatigue as the inspiration for this pricing model experiment. One might be hard pressed to build any type of business website on WordPress without purchasing any subscriptions for plugins. Users are so inundated with subscriptions that MasterWP was inspired to create <a href=\"https://wpwallet.com/\">WP Wallet</a>, a service that helps users keep track of license renewals and helps agencies bill for client subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fellow veteran product creator Brian Gardner called OrganizeWP&#8217;s pricing model &#8220;a bold (and refreshing) move,&#8221; but it&#8217;s the market that will decide if it is successful. Will customers be grateful for purchasing the plugin as a one-time payment or will they expect a constant stream of new features for the price?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The market may say that WordPress product customers have come to know, expect, and be comfortable with the subscription model,&#8221; Christopher said. &#8220;Selling major versions means that updates will be nothing more than maintenance releases and bug fixes, no new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;New major versions will need to be&nbsp;<em>pitched</em>&nbsp;to existing customers and that feeling of getting features &#8216;for free&#8217; is gone with this pricing model. Customers may&nbsp;<em>hate</em>&nbsp;that, I’m not sure yet.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 21:30:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce to Stop Registering Customizer Options in Upcoming 6.9 Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=136922\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-to-stop-registering-customizer-options-in-upcoming-6-9-release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2480:\"<p>WooCommerce is making a strong push towards getting the Customizer menu out of the admin for those who are using a block theme. In an effort to clean up the admin and eliminate confusion, the plugin will <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/08/11/stop-registering-customizer-options-for-block-themes/\">stop registering Customizer options when a block theme is active</a> beginning with version 6.9.

Developers can opt to use the <code>customize_register</code> action to include Customizer menu items, but continuing to offer Customizer options is not an ideal user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Subpanels or sections registered within the WooCommerce panel on the Customizer will no longer be accessible since the Customizer links will be removed,&#8221; WooCommerce engineer Alba Rincón said in the announcement. &#8220;If you’re the developer of a theme or extension that relies on the presence of these you will need to make changes to ensure a smooth transition.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce core developers recommend plugin authors update their products to relocate any Customizer settings to a block, pattern, or the Global Styles menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community developers are also invited to weigh in on a change that may impact developers&#8217; debugging workflows.

Big thanks to <strong>David Bisset</strong> in his former role as host and curator here, and also to our intern and post-production engineer, <strong>Olivia Bisset</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">This week we\'re talking about pay transparency. Ny relates some personal experiences where an employer did not disclose pay or how employees were selected for raises. This leads us into a discussion of pay transparency in the hiring process — how it matters to everyone but especially job seekers who are black, indigenous, or other people of color. (Ny <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is-why-we-need-pay-transparency-in-tech/\">has written about this before</a>, and <strong>Piccia Neri</strong> has been investigating the topic lately.) We also talk about how a lack of transparency can seem to emphasize an employer\'s distrust and an employee\'s disadvantaged position — and the effect that can have on workplace culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/techtwitter?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#techtwitter</a> & <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> Twitter & <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/womenintech?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#womenintech</a>, there\'s still time to vote in this poll! <br /><br />No salary range in job adverts: yay or nay? <a href=\"https://t.co/p1nRvnGGCB\">https://t.co/p1nRvnGGCB</a></p>&mdash; Piccia Neri (@Piccia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Piccia/status/1557682199067037696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 11, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we talk about our own family histories which are touched — in living memory in Ny\'s case — by slavery and colonialism where work and dignity were extracted from some people by others with the power take their labor without compensation. Ny\'s great grandfather was born a slave in South Carolina in 1858 and lived until 1963. Dan\'s ancestors include German settlers in North Carolina who abandoned their earlier beliefs against slavery and began to practice it in the late 1700s. In the Americas and beyond, the past is much closer than we often assume, especially for BIPOC people. History only &#8220;bends toward justice&#8221; if people choose to bend it that way. It can also go the other way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we close with how <strong>Allie Nimmons</strong> experienced a surprising level of hostility to a survey she presented to the WordPress community about the ways we contribute to the project and how we feel about it. There\'s the community we have now — and the community we need to become. How do we get there? What are the barriers? How can you help?</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-41 wp-block-columns sponsor has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"StellarWP\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-39 wp-block-column\">\n<h3 class=\"StellarWP\" id=\"Sponsor\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/stellarwp\">StellarWP</a><a href=\"https://poststat.us/wpengine\"></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>StellarWP</strong> provides WordPress solutions for all humankind.

Pretty good. Good to see you again. so what\'s on your mind in world of WordPress this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Pay transparency. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Okay. Me too. Yeah. So peach and Mary, um, who\'s, uh, I think pretty well known and post status member, um, proposed this some time ago and I\'ve been, you know, kind of encouraging and helping along towards an article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we know that we do job listings and there\'s always, there are things around. Time zones and where people specify they want people to be from or language that sometimes need a little nudging about [00:01:00] appropriateness, um, for being inclusive, but probably the single most vexing thing to people is, um, a reasonable pay for positions in a field that tends to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somewhat underpaid where we want to bring that up. Um, but you know, as in most job listings, LinkedIn, anywhere, a lot of employers just won\'t pay post any salary at all. And there may be kind of vagueness about, is this a senior position entry level? And yeah, what\'s the compensation. Some companies are really awesome about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but some are vague to just don\'t don\'t mention it. Mm-hmm so, um, So she was surveying. Yeah. What did you think of her, her poll and the discussion that happened on Twitter?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I thought it was really good. Um, I actually wrote, um, for master WP a little while ago about pay [00:02:00] transparency and how more companies need to just post their salaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, of course it gets pushed back, not my article, but that idea gets pushed back from companies, especially in places like South Carolina where, you know, They really do want to discriminate and pay and not care about it. Um, but I thought it was excellent and I think more companies should do it. Also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanna point out that Colorado already has a state law that does this. And, um, one interesting thing about that is so many companies have been major companies like Southwest airlines have been trying to, can I name. Oh, yeah. Okay. they, um, you know, they\'re one of the people to fight against it and the companies are like trying to like take the jobs out of Colorado.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I think it was Southwest. Let me not slander Southwest. And it\'s not them. I\'m gonna double check</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> because they\'re so embarrassed about their salary. They don\'t wanna have to post it. I mean, you\'ll leave the state cuz of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Like I feel like, but that, and also they want to pay people differently. [00:03:00] Like yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> So they don\'t wanna be seen doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. Like they know it\'s wrong. So like they know it\'s wrong. They know it\'s not the right thing to do, but they\'re still going to do it. And it\'s just come on, man. It\'s 2022. But like we were talking about, we\'re not that removed from first of all. Well, a lot of discrimination still happens today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s undeniable, but we\'re not that removed from legalized discrimination. Mm-hmm . Yeah. And I think a lot of companies, you know, we don\'t have a federal law to make you post, um, your salaries, but we need to one, um, two, a lot of companies don\'t know how much. Better. It makes them look, if they go ahead and do that, just jump ahead of the curve and have those salaries up there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So people know like we\'re getting paid, what we\'re worth one. We\'re not wasting our time with the interview. We don\'t want the pay and we\'re not being discriminated against by color, race, [00:04:00] gender, sexuality, things like that. Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> So I think, um, it\'s gonna be interesting to see how, how PT develops that, how we pull that article together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe I\'ll, I\'ll have to get, get you in on that too, for some feedback, or maybe some, some quotes too. Uh, have you had experiences directly with where you applied for, for something not quite knowing what the range was cause they didn\'t tell you or do you have personal rule about like, I\'m not gonna look at that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh, yeah. Um, so living in South Carolina, almost most of my life, um, it\'s a state that doesn\'t have a lot of, um, protection for employees, a very anti-union state. Um, I remember, um, working in college for a, I\'m not gonna name, drop them. Um, I don\'t want them to get the attention, um, working for a company where I made food and delivered it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, they told us when we were first hired, they were like, you [00:05:00] know, We\'re open about this and I\'m like, oh, it\'s gonna be something positive. And I\'m like, what are you hoping about? Well, uh, raises are given at the discretion of managers. So, you know, mm we\'re just gonna let you know. I\'m like, why were you so excited to tell me that, that, that sucks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you don\'t like me, I don\'t get a raise. Yep. But they were like, well, at least we told you, we didn\'t just like do it like that. Doesn\'t make it better, but they thought it made it better. And, um, I worked at that job for a little while and. Uh, personal story. So I, I don\'t, I haven\'t told the story a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think publicly, um, our manager was very sweet, very sweet guy and, um, very personable. I had no issues with him and I remember one day he asked if I wanted to come to his house and like, just hang out and like, I didn\'t think anything of it, but I was busy. I wasn\'t gonna do it. like, I was like 20 at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn\'t really care. I was like, um, oh no, I\'m I\'m busy. And he was like, oh, okay. Like, I thought it was like a simple conversation. He was like, okay. You know, no worries. And I guess a couple people had, they went and hung out with him one on one. [00:06:00] And I noticed in the next couple of weeks, it was just like a complete personality change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He just like made little side comments about working with me. Um, like I said, oh, you\'re on the line with Naisha today. Ugh. Okay. I guess. Nice, you know, I\'m joking. And I\'m like, what? And I didn\'t think of it at the time. I was just like, whatever, I\'m in college, like I\'m taking like four, like 20 credits and I\'m doing the shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part-time, I\'m not gonna think about it. But, um, I remember like in the next few weeks, like people who were getting hired on after me, cuz I help open the store. Um, they had raises. They got their 25 cents, which was a big deal at the time, I guess. And, um, a couple of them that I trained, they became like managers and supervisors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was sitting there with my $7 and doing all this work for nothing. And when I quit that job, you know, some of the guys were telling me, cuz it was mostly a, a guy job that they hired and then they rarely hire people of color. Um, they were like, you know, you really should have, uh, been nicer to. So and so, and I was like, [00:07:00] they were like, yeah, we used to hang out and do all the stuff that cover in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You never wanted to do it. Yeah. What. . I was like, that guy asked me one time when I first started to come to this house. I said, no, and that\'s why y\'all wouldn\'t pay me or promote me. Yeah. So I was like, you know, I was done with that company. I, I don\'t even eat their food to this day. Um, and they\'re not doing well as a company either, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, I shouldn\'t say that, but it\'s great to me now. but, um, I just, that was like the first time as an adult. Cause I was 20 or 21, um, that something was so blatantly. That blatantly happened. And it was like, I didn\'t even think until later on I\'m like, what if he, like, would\'ve tried to like touch me or something like, like, I, I didn\'t even think of that at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was just a simple, like, I\'m busy, I\'m in college, I\'m doing all this stuff. Like, dude, we can hang out another time. And it was like, after that, there was this just whole narrative of she\'s mean she doesn\'t wanna do this, deny her money. So I think at a company where there would\'ve been paid transparency, Where you didn\'t rely on [00:08:00] being favored by the boss?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, things like that, that I would\'ve been paid what I was due, which probably still, it was 25 cents more. It wasn\'t, I still think I was worth more than that, but I would\'ve been promoted. I wouldn\'t trained my, you know, replacements in, you know, superiors. Um, so that\'s, I always think about that story when I think about pay transparency because.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I was very young and naive and I was, I was naive for a long time and it\'s like, how do we protect other people from that? Not just women, cuz it happens to men, but mostly women. How, how do we protect people of color from that? Like how do we stop that from happening? And I think pay transparency is the first step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. I\'m, I\'m really, um, impressed and pleased that Colorado took that step. And that\'s, that\'s interesting how. Impacts distributed companies with people working remotely employers there, like, like yours, like Rob mm-hmm consulting, um, based [00:09:00] in, in, in Colorado, but teams all over the place. Um, so you\'re kind of benefiting from Colorado is progressive in South Carolina, despite South Carolina.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, nice. This is, this is something we can do in distributed companies to change cultures, to make. Where we see, you know, kinda gross inequities. Um, but yeah. What do you, what do you think, um, what do you think it does to for, I, I think, I think a lot of employers have the great intentions and I\'d stick up for \'em.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, there\'s reason. There\'s plenty of feedback and reasons for why, why we, we want to have this conversation later, or it\'s, it\'s a variable thing, or we don\'t wanna scare people off who we\'d like to get in the role by, um, you know, that\'s kind of a feed, but who\'s time are you, you wasting here [00:10:00] potentially, but yeah, they want to cast the net maybe widely, but there\'s two sides to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, if they really value building. A positive, collegial, collaborative environment that makes their people better as they grow there and is inclusive. Um, what does it do potentially? To start off with this kind of shell game or, you know, what\'s the three card Monty kinda game of how much would you would require her to be paid for this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How much do you think you\'re worth? Which is, um, some personalities and some people in certain experiences and some people on a depressing day. I mean, that\'s a hard, you\'re just not gonna represent yourself. Well, and you don\'t have like an advocate at your arm to do this and. What do you, you know, you can tell what I, I think about it, but what, [00:11:00] what are your, what are your thoughts for the long term impact on that company culture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you start off with oh, degree of non-transparency and, and suspicion, or trying to leverage the power, you have to employer side advantage, um, over the employee, um, .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> A lot of people probably won\'t agree with me because this is the status quo, but the world is changing. If companies continue to do that, these mind games, they won\'t have a company you\'re losing good talent because you want to play these mind games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to, I\'m the guy in, not this, I\'m the person in power. I don\'t want to, um, say it\'s only guys that do it, cuz it\'s not only guys, but I\'m the person in power. Let\'s see what let\'s see if I can, uh, how many tricks I can get out of them. before I can get, you know, them in. And then to me, it sets the stage for how it\'s going to be working at [00:12:00] this company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\'m gonna apply into this job with all these mind games and tricks, and I\'m jumping through hoops and I have to make sure it\'s not a joke when he says this or that. And they say this or that. Oh my God, I\'m so sorry. Um, but um, I have to go through all these hoops and then. I\'m stressed out. I\'m like sweating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I need the money. I need the job. I get the job. I\'m like, whew. All right. It\'s Monday. What game do I have to play today? So you\'re going to have depressed workers. You\'re gonna have stressed out workers. You\'re gonna have burnt out workers and eventually. Hopefully when they learn their value, they\'re going to quit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think employers can do this, but they\'re gonna have, they\'re gonna have a high turnover rate. They\'re not going to attract the best talent because they\'re, so they\'re just losing so many with that. And the company\'s culture is going to suck as well as the world. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> And I, I kind of appreciate more and more how, um, how, you know, there\'s an interpersonal [00:13:00] ethical level where.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re maybe hurting someone in their, you know, immediate lives with, um, with a, a work environment that doesn\'t build them up. And mm-hmm, , um, puts them in a situation where they have to, um, you know, not really know if they\'re at parody with their peers and, and colleagues or what they\'re worth, or, um, and if you damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, there\'s, there\'s a certain amount of human capital that employers just assume, you know, we just produce it, you know, our mm-hmm and it, you know, there\'s a whole, all the people that are holding us up, family, friends, and, and, and time off and rest and, and all of that. If, if you\'re just depleting people and you don\'t put that back, ultimately you\'re hurting the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Culture like for us, um, WordPress tech industry, you know, it\'s, it\'s, [00:14:00] it\'s damaging how the larger culture works and, and, you know, your, your employees move on to someone else than they mm-hmm , you know, they\'re are we, we should want to pass people out better than they were when they came in. Yeah. Or at least as, as good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, so it\'s not, uh, you\'re not damaging people. You\'re not damaging our ecosystem. Um, I, I feel like a human, I don\'t like the term. I kind of reject the term human resource, but mm-hmm , if you\'re gonna look at things kind of ecologically, you shouldn\'t draw down on that human resource. That\'s a commons too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our labor commons in, in WordPress. So yeah, hopefully this conversation that, that will, will continue and. Yeah, your, your article, I think was the first I\'ve seen someone kind of bring that out and yeah. I want to have to put you impeach it together. [00:15:00] Oh, okay. Have you met her?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I have not. No. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. It\'s, it\'s an important, important issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so I think two, we were, we were talking earlier about, um, mm-hmm, the, the history that\'s kind of at our backs too. Mm-hmm and. what people have been through and what in living memory, in their, in their family touches them, you know, it\'s different and we\'re not always sensitive to that, that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in the United States, you know, Canada\'s got another version of this here. There\'s if you\'re people don\'t exist in a vacuum and they don\'t come to you, um, in a vacuum and. When you, when you faced employers like that, where there\'s a clear, you know, we\'re gonna arbitrarily use, give managers power over you, does that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does that, [00:16:00] how does that register to you in the context of your family history? That someone like me probably doesn\'t have,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> well, it\'s always a red flag, especially with power plays and. You know, I\'m gonna tie it back to American slavery. Everyone\'s favorite topic . And so, uh, we talked a little bit about, um, living memory and how it\'s not that far back for that many people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have a very large family, a very old family and the things they experienced that they it\'s still, first of all, it\'s not that long ago and it\'s still. Just basically shapes what I do and how I feel about things today and specifically, um, you know, people like to talk about slavery. Um, well, so long ago, none of you guys knew any slaves and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s not true, especially from my family. Um, so I sent you an article about my great, great grandfather Jefferson do. And, uh, he was born in the 1950s. So he was born into [00:17:00] slavery in South Carolina and he lived a hundred. In 1850s, he lived 105 years. That\'s how old he was when he died. Wow. Um, so he lived until the 19, um, sixties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm um, as a matter of fact, the equal pay act, um, was, um, It passed in 1963, that was there. He died. So, um, my great-grandfather was alive for, uh, slavery. He lived through the civil war. He lived through the creation of the automobile. He lived through, you know, the early civil rights movements, um, Rosa parks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was alive to see Martin Luther king Jr. Walk, you know, and my mom was alive. My mom was, um, about eight. When he, he died, she still remembers running errands for him. My mom knew him. He was a slave. He was born into slavery. Um, his granddaughters, they were in their thirties. When he, when they died twenties or thirties, they\'re still alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three of them, um, in their late eighties. And, um, he was the patriarch of our family and the things he taught [00:18:00] them, the things he taught his sons, the things he taught his grandsons, his great grandsons that shaped our family that shaped our worldview. He would tell them, you know, these are things we did in slavery, but now that you all don\'t have to do that, this is what you should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He told people that are still alive that today . Yeah. Um, so people don\'t realize how long ago, long ago. Wasn\'t yeah, we had laws in the book with just when he, he was not a, a free person when he was born. And by the time he died, there was a equal rights amendment for pay between men and women that was in the sixties that wasn\'t that long ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So . Legalized discrimination and pay is still happening. You know, they, that amendment doesn\'t go far enough. It doesn\'t protect against race, sexuality, religion, things like that. Um, just the things that happened to him. What happened to his daughters? What happened to his granddaughters? Those things follow me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His grand, his great granddaughter. [00:19:00] My mother integrated her high school. She was always paid less than everybody else. She went to H B, C U cuz. She could not go to other colleges. This was the seventies. Yeah. I\'m not talking about 2, 3, 400 years ago. Um, you know, so you know, my family always stressed education, getting the best education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They always stressed working somewhere where your employer respects you because it wasn\'t too long ago where they didn\'t have a. Yep. So I think it would take these companies. They would be well reminded to remember the people that they deal with, especially people of color in the United States. We\'ve been dealing with this stuff more recently than you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So do you want to be a company that\'s known as one that lived in the past that kept these bad things going? Or do you want to be known as a progressive company that was ahead of the curve? Yeah, they had the laws in Colorado, but your company in South Carolina, why don\'t you, why don\'t you jump ahead of the curve too?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why don\'t you do this? Why don\'t you do that? Yeah. Why don\'t you be the best you can be? Why don\'t you take this lemon me memory cuz it\'s all of our history, even though it happened to a certain subject we\'re Americans, it [00:20:00] happened to all of us. Yeah. All of us were a part of this. When this happened, our, our ancestors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Touched</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> all of the Americas touched everything and it Europeans doing it it\'s it was a global global system. And yeah, in a hundred years, you know, two, three generations in a family that\'s living memory and it\'s it\'s a hundred years. And that seems like a long time, but that\'s body memory. That\'s, you know, you\'re, was it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is kind of more tended to in, in trauma, uh, psychology and understanding of that. And, you know, the, what is it? The genetically you are part of, um, an egg formed in your mother\'s mother mm-hmm and. This goes, it\'s a long, it\'s a long way back his, and you don\'t have to scratch the surface of any community to, to find the history [00:21:00] of, um, traumas there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, mm-hmm , you know, I think I told you about, like, when I researched family history, one, one branch of my, um, uh, German Moravian ancestors who started out pacifists and abolitionists. And, and so on one branch went down and founded Winston Salem, North Carolina. And, um, they decided it would be okay if they had slaves, but treated them as spiritual equals, just not labor equals mm-hmm oldest black church in, in America is still running there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they\'re still in a kind of reconciliation process cuz there\'s um, it was, um, yeah, not a. Not a good thing, not a good outcome. And it\'s um, so yeah, my part of my family is on the other side of that. And you, I think if you, you dig down, it\'s not that far in Canada, we\'re dealing with. What everyone knew, but is now very publicly aware that [00:22:00] as late as the sixties, indigenous kids were being stripped from their families, put in the religious schools and, um, for cultural assimilation by force, and a lot of them were abused and died in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These mass graves that are coming up. And, um, what do we have to say about that is people are. Very touched in their families by, by that, that experience. Um, so yeah, I don\'t, I don\'t see how you can talk about, we want an inclusive culture without, and being historically ignorant of these mm-hmm of these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. And people need to listen to people of color when they talk about this too. Like, I can trace my family back to here and we experience this stuff until now. Like, this is what you should do to make it more inclusive to help us. Oh, yeah, that\'s fine and dandy, but no, mm-hmm, no more butts. No, if ands or butts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.[00:23:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> So moving, moving from one, one survey to another. So, you know, peach is doing the survey unemployment, um, Practices and, you know, it\'s a, it is a bit of a hot button, potential thing there mm-hmm um, and as far as I know, um, she\'s had all kinds of responses that have been cordial and professional and, and fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\'s a, a white European woman. Um, and I\'m, I\'m glad I hope I\'m right about that. That that\'s, that\'s been. A question and a public kind of probing that we can handle maturely. But then yesterday we see Allie Nimmons, um, talking about a, what I would think is a much more benign survey, um, and getting a [00:24:00] lot, lot of shit mm-hmm and that\'s just not a not appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And she\'s an African American woman. Um, Makes you think what, tell, tell me what your thoughts are, what, what, um, and what Allie was, was trying to do there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, so Allie was, you know, just trying to do a survey. Um, she\'s really, everybody knows. Allie is really big on WordPress contribution and, um, she\'s just trying to get a feel of how easy or hard it is for people to contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can go about addressing ways to make it easier for. Simply it, you know, I think that\'s great. Um, you know, I see stuff every day about, we need more contributions to WordPress. Why anybody would be against people trying to help that I have no idea, but, um, the, a lot of comments she got were so passive aggressive, and that\'s not the first time I\'m seeing that in the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, People are very, [00:25:00] very passive aggressive. When you ask questions. Um, no matter how benign they are, people, they have to flip it, especially if it\'s not like the questions they want to ask, which to me, I\'m just going to say they need to work on, but you know, that\'s all I wanna say about that, but I just think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people didn\'t consciously see, it\'s like, she\'s asking these questions. This is African American woman. The, all of the bad responses I saw were not from African Americans. And I don\'t think anywhere from women and they were just kind of jumping down her throat like, oh, you didn\'t ask this question the way I want you to ask it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I can\'t do this because this is not the way I would do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>what, first of all, what do you like? I, I wanna ask these people, like, do you talk to people like that at your job? Do you say, no, I can\'t help you with this project cuz you didn\'t do it the way I, [00:26:00] I wanted you to do it. Right. I, I, how many people like yourself do you talk to like that? But you know, I\'m not saying they were consciously malicious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will give them the benefit of the doubt, but that was something I just really didn\'t like to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And did you say, since you were working on, on this with her, this was, this was for, um, master WP, um, surveying. Um, yes, yes. Yeah. Did you say that there was, um, like you have some guys. Giving the kind of response of like, is this open to white people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this a closed survey? Like for, there\'s no reason to think that, right. Yeah. Other than that, she\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> running it black. Yeah. Why would you ask, why would you ask someone that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> they just assume, because she\'s running it, that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> it\'s a diverse survey. Yeah. There\'s no, it\'s only people of color. What, in your mind, how does your mind work to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, that, that was the response that annoyed me the [00:27:00] worst.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I have a hard time believing. They actually think that they are just have a chip on their shoulder because of their perception of what all kind of stands for in their mind. As I think reasonably outspoken person who is really good at taking on a lot of issues, we need to talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> The best, honestly,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> really okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> And, um, yeah, I just, I think it also comes from it\'s the community. That\'s another issue with us in diversity. We need a more diverse community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, she\'s doing it. Oh, basically for a long time anyway. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you\'re, there\'s other, there\'s a lot more, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah, people had like interactions with people who don\'t look like them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They would know when a person is asking a genuine question. That\'s why I\'m yelling from the clouds. We need a more diverse WordPress, because it\'s not enough to tell people this is how you\'re diverse or what we\'re just talking about. Like, you know, the history of us, and this is how we [00:28:00] interact, and this is how you can make it easier for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not enough to tell people that they need to experience this. They need empathy. They need to, they need to talk to people. Yeah. So pushing from more diversity and WordPress will definitely help with that. It definitely will. I I\'m sure we will see the difference. and I,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I think kindness and basic respect, um, the negative outcome here is, you know, at least in the moment and the emotion of it now, like ally says, she\'s not gonna do one of these surveys again, and that\'s not what we want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just having, doing something as simple as that, asking people on about a contribution to the project, um, That she gets kind of targeted in that way is just not a not okay. And to, to demo demoralize people, anyone out of doing productive, constructive work, like that is, is not something that is [00:29:00] healthy in any way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s still, you know, it\'s completely what we don\'t want. Mm-hmm um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>yeah, I hope I hope that comes out. In a better, better result than just we never ask these, these kind of things again. But, um, I, I re I, I recognize I was, you know, telling you about this before. I, I recognize where that comes from, and it, it\'s not just men, but there is, there is that white male fragility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, I have, you know, I have that inside me too. There\'s like the, everyone\'s got a scared, frustrated child or, you know, there\'s that part of you, it\'s not your best self. And maybe in some people it gets the better of them a lot more. It it\'s in charge. Um, you got your own wounds, you got your own sense of grievances and why [00:30:00] wasn\'t, uh, why am I not, blah, blah, blah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you can see is someone else is getting preference ahead of me or something like that. I mm-hmm, totally admit to having a part that feels that has felt that. So I don\'t, I don\'t know. The big question for me is, and that came up in Michelle\'s misogyny article an issue. I don\'t know quite what to say to men who, um, I recognize where that comes from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. and it\'s really hard to know how to say this is something you gotta grow on in a con in a constructive way. Cause I think it\'s a genuine failure. It\'s mm-hmm , it\'s a, there\'s not a better, uh, better word for it. It\'s a, it is a genuine and common thing to have from being. Growing up in a, in a culture that doesn\'t have this kind of history at its back that we [00:31:00] were talking about that takes for granted things that are privilege, but we don\'t see it that way until we learn to see it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm until you, you move into it a different environment or something changes for you for, for me, it was, you know, after I was 12 or so, that was probably the last time I lived in a highly. Homogenous kind of environment and was mm-hmm generally in a minority myself. So, um, if you don\'t get stuff like that, I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, it\'s not an easy thing to grow on. And then you got grown men who, you know, they\'re, they haven\'t grown on that. Do you have any, any thoughts on that? Like how is that a, how do we crack that in? And it it\'s, it\'s a tough one, cuz you can. It deserves to be aggressively treated, but that, but still with, in some kindness and [00:32:00] understanding because you don\'t get anywhere with people, um, when you\'re both feeling grievance and anger,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I think, and I don\'t know if this is like, I would have to think on it more, but my first thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think this process, cause it\'s been a while it\'s called, I think they called it sugaring. I don\'t, if that\'s not it, please forgive me. But, um, it\'s a process of just going through an unlearning internal biases that you may have, because like I said, I don\'t think most of these people did it maliciously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and just for an example where I learned this term, um, I got to meet some of the feminists of South Carolina, some of the, uh, older ones who helped write like the sexual assault laws and things like that. The most badass women I\'ve ever met in my life. Oh my gosh. And um, my old neighbor actually was one of them too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Hey, Dr. Sally Boyd. Um, but, uh, they were just incredible women and they talked about, you know, just fighting for different things for [00:33:00] women in the seventies and sixties and eighties in South Carolina. Um, they help integrate the Sears downtown because they didn\'t, uh, have black, uh, they didn\'t want black clerks out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funny story from that, what they did was one of the women had like five children and. They went to Sears and she was like, they told \'em just to let her children go. And they ran everywhere because they would go to talk to a manager and the manager would just never wanna talk to them. But when they let those children, wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clerks were so busy. The manager had to come out and talk to them. So , you know, but before they got to actually actions like that, which was incredible by the way, cuz these were rich, upper class white. And, you know, they believe in the quality for all, they were fighting for African American women to have this right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before they got to that step, they had to unlearn biases that they had. Again, they were upper class, white, rich women from the south. They were in a whole nother, you know, ballpark, a whole nother ballgame. And, uh, one of them talked about how one of the women they met was a doctor, but before they met her, they just heard they were talking to [00:34:00] Dr.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, and so let\'s say Dr. Brown, Dr. Brown was coming to meet with them and they thought it was going to be her husband. and the woman walked in and it\'s like, you know, these are, these are feminists. They, they have, you know, actions they\'ve done, but they still had this notion that when I hear doctor as a man yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, things like that. So they told us like, you know, even though you all may think you\'re feminist, you may think you\'re, uh, freedom fighters. You may think you\'re, uh, fighting for people underneath you or your own race or your own gender. We all have these biases that we have to unlearn. And we all have to go through this process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don\'t think white men in particular. Told a lot to, you know, we need to go through this process and this is how so I think sugaring and I hope that\'s the word again, um, is what they do. If that\'s not the world, I\'ll correct myself. Next time we talk, I\'m gonna look it up. But, um, we just have to get together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, they have to get together and, um, just unlearn stuff and it starts with education. It starts with talking with other people, um, check your privilege, I guess, is what the kids say these days. [00:35:00] yeah. So yeah, I think that would be the most helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, sugaring to me sounds, sounds, um, I\'m thinking of sweet tea and yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trying to sweeten a otherwise bitter thing, but, um, mm-hmm yeah. I hear, hear what you\'re saying. I, yeah, and it, it probably never, it never really ends. My, my experience with it is, is you just kind of find, um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>we\'re probably all better off acknowledging that we\'ve got, you know, you got, you got a shadow, you got a dark spot and you know, everyone\'s heart has got, uh, you know, that, that side that go, when things go, you know, you, you don\'t want the person you don\'t want to be, or hopefully you don\'t, you don\'t want, you know, the, the worst self is, is there in everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And. um, doesn\'t wanna [00:36:00] listen to other, other people is more concerned with its own, own sense of, um, entitlement or injuries or, or, or even even needs. And, um, yeah, that\'s a tough, tough thing to, um, to get people to, to take seriously and, and handle well, unless it\'s in, in a kind of community relational context where you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friendship and peer collegiality and respect as such a part of the culture and a priority that it\'s hard. You, you, it gives you a baseline. I, I, I think that\'s where all, all forms of contribution should feed that, that, um, that we\'re, we kind of hold each other up because. Open sources based on trust, like any, any good [00:37:00] community, any good relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you got that, you can kind of hold each other up a bit and tolerate some of some degree of conflict that\'s necessary and, and disagreement and hurt feelings and, and all that. But I not, not really that good at it all the time, probably better than some other communities, but I don\'t know if that matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> No worries. I, I agree with you. It\'s just communication and holding your community. A responsible charity begins at home. My grandmother always said that. So we look out for our community. Our community will look out for other communities. It\'s kind of like paying it forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I, um, I think it\'s important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m glad I, I kind of know, we know something of each other, like where we live our stories or mm-hmm, , you know, background and I feel like in. Context. That\'s important to kind of slowly tell those stories and know that stuff for each other grounds, grounds things makes it harder to do that [00:38:00] internet psychosis, where it\'s not real people that you\'re shooting at, you know, just venting on or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and it makes kindness more the common ground. Well, that\'s a lot covered a lot. Oh yeah. We . We always do. Yeah. Well, that\'s. Maybe maybe next time we\'ll do do some more, um, techy, newsy stuff, but, um, yeah. Got a really good, a good question from someone who is outside the community and kind of, you know, wants to, to get in senior developer, wasn\'t done a lot of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would you advise that I do to get in? We\'ve had a bunch of answers come and, um, yeah, it\'d be interested in your take on some stuff like that.

This idea resonated with participants in the discussion and plans are now underway to use a stripped-back version of Twenty Twenty-Two as the base for the new theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic design director Channing Ritter <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/10/twenty-twenty-three-default-theme-project-kickoff/\">published</a> a preview of what the base theme might look like with sample variations applied, along with the <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1139275543113752375\">Figma design mockups</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-Three&#8217;s predecessor has a highly opinionated design. The upcoming default theme is more like a blank canvas with the spotlight on the style variations. Headings are not as prominent, typography has been replaced with system fonts, and there are no images included. The theme will use the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-13-8-introduces-fluid-typography-support-and-revamped-quote-block\">fluid typography</a> feature released in Gutenberg 13.8, and has spacing presets in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One important note is that we are limited in the number of fonts we can include with the theme and should aim to use 3–4 different typefaces across all variations (in addition to systems fonts),&#8221; Ritter said. The initial list includes the following fonts, but can evolve based on contributors&#8217; feedback:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>System sans serif font</li><li>IBM Plex Mono</li><li>DM Sans</li><li>Source Serif Pro</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most exciting aspect of this project is that WordPress&#8217; design contributors have invited the community to take a stab at submitting their own style variations for consideration. The variations that are selected will ship as part of the upcoming default theme. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas many default themes in the past have come from a single designer or from an existing theme, Twenty Twenty-Three (TT3) will offer a kaleidoscope of style variations from different community contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme in progress is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree\">available on GitHub</a> and anyone can try their hand at creating a style variation. There are three different ways to do it. The most straightforward for some will be to create an alternate theme.json file and edit the code directly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who prefer to design their own variation visually in the editor can make changes to the Global Styles panel and then save them as a new style variation using the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/\" target=\"_blank\">Create Block Theme plugin</a>. This opens up contribution to anyone with design skills, even if they do not feel comfortable editing the theme.json file. Alternatively, contributors can design static mockups in Figma or another program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More detailed instructions for submitting a style variation are available in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/08/10/twenty-twenty-three-default-theme-project-kickoff/\">post</a> and those interested to contribute can join the new  <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/tag/core-themes-projects/\">#core-themes-projects</a> Slack channel to ask questions and connect with others who working on the same project. The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentythree/issues/34\">first variation submission</a> to the TT3 repository is from new contributor Colin Chadwick, who created an eggplant color scheme complemented by the DM Sans font. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community is full of talented designers and this call for style variations is an incredible opportunity to contribute without having to touch any code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Style variation submissions for this project will close on August 31. The final curated set will be announced on September 7. The new TT3 default theme will ship with WordPress 6.1, which is expected on October 25, 2022.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Aug 2022 02:09:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"Matt: Telegram Channel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=59104\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://ma.tt/2022/08/telegram-channel/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:509:\"<p>You can now subscribe to updates from this blog in <a href=\"https://t.me/+oMWZJFfyMok2ZmUz\">this Telegram channel</a>!
